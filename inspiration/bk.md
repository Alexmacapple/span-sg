Introduction

People usually want to get into doing accessibility work to make products and services more usable by disabled people. They picture doing accessible design, development, or testing full time, or perhaps being a specialist that people come to for help with accessibility problems.

But then, between being asked for the thousandth time what alt text is and building yet another slide deck to try to convince yet another team that accessibility is “good for everyone,” we find ourselves doing a lot of other things. Those things might be training for the whole organization, advocacy to leadership, program management, change management, and many other types of work. Because accessibility touches all those things, people that “do” accessibility will be able to do all these things, too, right?

If that last bit raised your heart rate, I apologize. It raised mine, too. I’ve collected a lot of evidence that people don’t burn out in our field because they no longer want to do accessibility work. They burn out because they can no longer do all the other work they are expected to do in addition to the core accessibility work.

How I got here

When I first got into accessibility work full time, circa 2012, it was mostly by accident. In a few short months, I ejected from a career in

digital library services, moved across the country, and got laid off by a startup.

I started contracting at a small digital agency and had a project to build a small site. I was already familiar with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). A mentor at my college internship in the library introduced them to me in 2001, and I had been using them ever since.

When I started this contract project, I had some accessibility concerns about the designs I was given. I was worried about reaching out to my contact at the agency to bring them up. I had a lot of imposter syndrome coming into the tech industry from libraries and higher education, so I worried a lot. Would he have any idea what I was talking about? Would he care? Would he think I was making excuses for not wanting to, or not being able to do, the work assigned?

Luckily, my contact had experience doing accessibility work, and he was so delighted about my pushback that I soon found myself hired full time. In a few months, with coaching, I was doing accessibility audits and leading clients through fixing issues. All things considered, my entry into the field was very typical, through a kind of informal apprenticeship that grew out of interest in making digital products more accessible. On one hand, entering the field this way was a happy accident that has led to a career and community. On the other hand, that kind of beginning, in a field barely a few decades old, did not prepare me for all that was to come.

Let us fast forward to approximately 10 years later, when I quit my job as a technical program manager for accessibility at a large tech company (I won’t mention the company by name here, but it’s very easy to find out). I quit because of burnout. I was extremely sick, having neglected my chronic illnesses for years in pursuit of the work. It took me a full year dedicated to recovery before I returned to the field as a part-time, self-employed consultant.

During that year, between pain clinic appointments and physical therapy sessions, I had a lot of time to think. I thought about ways that I could return to doing accessibility work so that it was healthy and sustainable for me. Then I wondered if I could help to make it more sustainable for others, too.

What this book is

This book is not a one-sized-fits-all solution to doing accessibility operations or building an accessibility program. You cannot hand this book to your manager and say, “This is it! This is the blueprint. I’ll be done next week.”

Much the opposite! This is a guidebook to help you explore what type of accessibility practice might work best for you and your organization.

This book is a collection of theories, philosophies, and techniques that I hope will make the work that happens around accessibility work easier for you. It pulls from my formal education as an information scientist, my work in libraries, higher education, nonprofits, agencies, and product companies, the 12-plus years I’ve been in this field, my politics, and my experiences as a disabled, chronically ill, neurodivergent person. This book is about burnout and avoiding burnout in the accessibility field, and an exorcism of my burnout experience.

This book is about strategies to build a sustainable, intersectional, operations-focused accessibility practice that centers anti-ableism.

This book is about creating an accessibility practice that is data-driven, pragmatic, and not reliant on your own exploitation and emotional labor.

This book is, hopefully, about helping you do accessibility work for as long as you want to.

How this book is organized

Chapters

Each chapter in this book includes a brief introduction at the beginning and a summary at the end. You can use these to see if you want to skip a particular chapter.

Parts

This book has two parts.

Part 1: Theory is a crash course in theories and frameworks I’ve found to be useful to build coalition, make change in organizations, and take care of myself.

Chapters in this section are about burnout, education and literacy, organizational theory, communities, and intersectionality. This part of the book is not exhaustive. It designed to get you thinking about ideas you might not have considered before in relation to accessibility work, and to give you the vocabulary to dive into your own research.

Part 2: Practice is about the practice of doing accessibility work.

It’s about operations, communication, services, program management, planning, and pre-planning. The goal of this section is to help you consider the types of activities you can do based on your

needs, resources, goals, and the ways you want to grow your practice.

Notes

Throughout the book, there are two kinds of notes.

Ĉ. Footnotes: These are noted with letters and provide extra commentary. These can also be found at the end of each chapter.

ĉ. Endnotes: These are noted with numbers and provide

references. The full list of endnotes appears at the end of the book.

Let’s begin.

Part 1: Theory

Everything is delicately interconnected. – Jenny Holzer

Chapter 1: Burnout

Interviewer: Have you experienced burnout? If yes, what do you do to deal with it?

Interviewee: [laughing] Has anyone answered ‘no’ to this question?

Interviewer: They haven’t.

What you’ll read: By the end of this chapter, you’ll know more about what burnout is, who it impacts the most in workplaces, and why. You’ll also learn why accessibility practitioners are prone to burnout.

This chapter has a content warning for descriptions of workplace trauma related to burnout. If you need to, go ahead and skip to the chapter summary, or jump ahead to Chapter 2: Education and literacy.

I wanted to know more about how burnout works and who is most at risk when I decided to write this book. I’m a social scientist at heart, so I did research. I reviewed papers about work burnout. I also reviewed a survey of accessibility practitioners I did in 2022 to see where burnout came up. I also conducted interviews with people who work in the field about their experiences. A

There were a lot of parallels between all these resources. There are a few reasons why that is, but before I get ahead of myself, I want to

be clear about what burnout is.

Defining burnout

Burnout is that feeling of disconnect, malaise, and general shittiness that you sometimes feel when you try to engage with something that is important to your life. It’s not boredom or laziness. It’s your body’s way of telling you that something is very wrong and that you need a break.

Burnout is insidious and joy-robbing because it can attach itself to the things you care most about, like your relationships, your job, and your hobbies. It can make you doubt yourself and your worth and why you ever cared about the thing that is now making you miserable.

Burnout is trauma, and when you understand that it makes a lot of things fall into place.

In a 2021 Mayo Clinic article titled “Job burnout: How to spot it and take action,” there is a list of questions to help readers identify if they have burnout from work. Over the course of writing this book, I’ve probably read this list a hundred times, and it still feels like a punch in the gut. Here it is:

Do you question the value of your work?

Do you drag yourself to work and have trouble getting started?

Do you feel removed from your work and the people you work with?

Have you lost patience with co-workers, customers or clients?

Do you lack the energy to do your job well?

Is it hard to focus on your job?

Do you feel little satisfaction from what you get done? Do you feel let down by your job?

Do you doubt your skills and abilities?

Are you using food, drugs or alcohol to feel better or to numb how you feel?

Have your sleep habits changed?

Do you have headaches, stomach or bowel problems, or other physical complaints with no known cause? 1

Take a moment and answer some of these questions for yourself. If you’ve been in the accessibility field for any length of time, you’ve probably experienced some, if not all, of these things.

Shell Little, an accessibility specialist, put this bluntly in her talk “The accessibility to burnout pipeline” when they said:

When you look up burnout factors, [they] probably feel very familiar to a lot of us who work in accessibility. These factors are disproportionately affecting accessibility specialists because, comically, those are just part of the job. 2

Sources of burnout

People usually experience burnout from multiple sources at once, not just work. For example, people I interviewed for this book mentioned having burnout related to racism, xenophobia, queerphobia, sexism, ableism, ageism, and other forms of discrimination.

Some also mentioned parenting and other responsibilities outside work as sources of burnout. Some talked about getting burnout from going to school or volunteering. People also have burnout from cultural and world events out of their control, like the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing genocide, and rising fascism.

All of this is to say that you are probably already experiencing burnout by being a human in 2024. You almost certainly have burnout if you are part of one or more marginalized communities. And you probably have burnout if you have a job, especially one you care about.

All these sources of burnout build on it each other until it’s difficult to separate the nuances between them. Just like it’s possible to have multiple disabilities or chronic illnesses, it’s possible to have burnout for multiple reasons. And while these different reasons might be unrelated on the surface, the symptoms—the ways they affect you day to day—ultimately blend. On a good day, you might be able to easily tell them apart and give them the space they need. On a bad day, it’s just a blur of pain, disconnect, and brain fog.

One practitioner described this cycle:

I deal with burnout by caring less. That's a coping mechanism, a disconnect from the disconnect that I'm feeling with the organization, which is really sad. It shouldn't be that way. I want to feel like I'm appreciated. I know my value. I know what I bring to the table, the potential this has. I understand that. It's bonkers, how good this could be. That's what's frustrating.

There are a couple of compounding themes for work burnout that came up in my research and interviews that are difficult to disentangle from each other. One is personal identity. The other is professional expectations. What personal and professional conditions might a person experience that make them prone to burnout? This question is important to answer.

Identity

Professionals who have one or more marginalized identities are at higher risk for work burnout. This is because they are probably already burned out by being in a professional space. This idea is part of minority stress theory, which says that marginalized people receive stress from society in general as well as their institutions or organizations in particular. 3

A 2021 study reported that 44% of Black people, Indigenous people, and other people of color (sometimes grouped into BIPOC) experienced work burnout. 40% of BIPOC have been discriminated against at work because of their race or ethnicity. 4 This was echoed in a 2023 study of BIPOC mental health practitioners, which

included “pre-pandemic exposure to burnout, systemic racism, racial discrimination; race-based stress or trauma; increased diversity and equity-related service responsibilities,” and other factors. 5

In addition to facing institutional racism, BIPOC mental health workers are likely to have work environments that cause burnout. These specifically create feelings of “emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishments,” which are all hallmarks of burnout. 6

Alexis Lucio, a senior accessibility designer, described a previous work experience with burnout, and its relationship with race and ethnicity:

I suffered severe burnout as a product designer. I was down for the count for nine months. I could not hold it together at work. I lost 15 pounds in six weeks because I couldn’t hold food.

I get credit as a traditionally marginalized person for being “resilient.” I hear “You’re so resilient” all the time. I’m like, I don’t want to be resilient! I don’t want to be strong. I saw what my ancestors have done to survive genocide and poverty and colonialism—I would like to invite softness and give them, and myself, a break.

While that happened in my late 20s, that was the thing I needed to protect my life going forward in my career. I knew that I needed to do that. I never wish what happened to me on anybody, even if I don’t like them. It’s so painful.

Similarly, a 2023 study found that queer medical students were exposed to “discrimination, harassment, and isolation” and were “significantly more likely” to have burnout more frequently and intensely than their straight counterparts. 7 This intensified for queer students who had multiple marginalized identities.

Another anonymous person I spoke with reflected on being a queer, disabled accessibility practitioner:

If I had the energy, I would raise a complaint against my former employer. Because not only from an LGBTQ perspective did I feel discriminated against, from a disability perspective, I was. I was definitely discriminated against, but I don’t have the capacity to do that.

I thought that I could go into this organization, knowing that I wanted to do two years’ worth of work, try and get systems in place, and then know that I wanted to leave after that and hope that I could actually also improve it for people with disabilities. And I was defeated due to discrimination, being othered, and by having my skills perpetually devalued.

One study I found reported that disabled workers often have low job satisfaction, high emotional exhaustion, and high cynicism. These are all closely tied to burnout. 8 Disabled people are also likely to stay in jobs they don’t like or which they find “under-challenging,” which also contributes to burnout. 9 They stay because it’s so hard to find work as a disabled person in the first place. This is amplified in places like the United States where many people above the poverty line depend on work for healthcare. 10

Even if people in the workplace aren’t overtly ableist, that undercurrent is usually still there. A disabled practitioner told me this about working on an accessibility project that was otherwise well-funded and well-supported:

Nobody could say directly that they weren’t interested [in accessibility], but you could see them being ableist or just trying to be friends with you and not treating you the same as another colleague without a disability, for example. I typically felt that they would try and be very nice to me. It’s a little bit like how you would treat kids to make them happy.

EJ Mason, an accessibility subject matter specialist, put it this way when I interviewed them:

To some extent, if you’re a disabled accessibility professional, you’re being asked to constantly not only engage with ableism, but also to make other people feel better about living in an ableist society when it’s actively harming you all the time.

It’s easy to go through life in a way that you don’t learn about ableism at all. I was in college before I learned the name for this thing that affected literally my entire life from the day that I was born. It’s the validation of, “Oh, there’s a word for this thing.” I’m not just different. I am obviously different from some people, but it’s not just me being picked on for some nebulous differences.

There’s a power structure that supports this behavior and this violence that you experienced or this alienation that you feel,

because even if no one’s being outwardly violent to you, you don’t have the support and tools to really belong with some of your peers. Also, there is a reward for enforcing those behaviors. It’s ableism all the way down.

This othering also extends to workers who are “invisibly” disabled or not “out” as disabled at work. A study found that:

[A] full 30% of the professional workforce fits the current federal definition of having a disability—and the majority are keeping that status a secret. B Only 39% of employees with disabilities have disclosed to their manager. Even fewer have disclosed to their teams (24%) and HR (21%). Almost none (4%) have revealed their disability to clients. 11

If you can mask your condition, you are burning energy on masking. This too can contribute to burnout.

Professional expectations

Working in a helping profession like mental health services, social work, and accessibility, can compound burnout. It’s no accident that a lot of burnout studies, even before COVID-19, were about people in these types of professions. There are many common factors, but I want to focus on a few that I think impact us most strongly.

Emotional labor

Professionals must often fake some of our emotions in the workplace to go along with organizational goals. This creates

“emotional dissonance” where our external and internal emotions clash. 12 That is, you feel pulled in two different directions. One direction is your actual emotions about your work and working environment. The other direction is the emotions your organization pressures you to perform.

This came up in multiple interviews. One anonymous practitioner told me:

I have found it incredibly difficult in taking on this job, combining what I’m passionate about and what I do for my daily job, to mask.

Mary Elizabeth Sullivan, a digital accessibility consultant and strategist, spoke to me about how ableist microaggressions at work built over time until it became difficult for her to mask anymore.

I started not only feeling the discrimination and the microaggressions against myself, because I was just so tired of having to deal with this stuff, but I also felt it viscerally for all the other people that I knew. That visceral frustration of seeing people in my life not being able to use something while having to have an hour-long conversation to deal with only five accessibility issues just became—The conversations felt inane. The feeling was visceral that they’re actually just really discriminating against people.

Knowing my community and myself and people I don’t know are impacted isn’t something I can turn off anymore. I don’t want to turn it off, to be honest.

Another anonymous practitioner put it bluntly:

What if the best thing we could do is just dismantle capitalism? Meanwhile, I’m like, “Yes, again, add alt text to your images, please.” It will have an impact, but I know the bigger problem is there, and I can’t do anything about it besides try to donate money or time or perspective.

Many practitioners mentioned one of the biggest emotional drains in our field: telling people the same basic information over and over again. Practitioners end up being broken records repeating the same accessibility basics to new people all the time.

And yes, education work does require repetition. But if the importance of accessibility isn’t reinforced by practice and priorities, it doesn’t survive turnover, reorgs, or changes in leadership. One practitioner described the feeling of gaining and losing ground.

I found out that our new CTO [Chief Technology Officer] had already some experience with accessibility, and he already understood why it was important. I was able to reach out and make that connection and share context. We had this great meeting. He was asking all these really great questions. I was able to fill him in with all the context that he was looking for.

I started to support the CTO and the inclusion of accessibility in his engineering and data health review sessions with his directors. That was a really big deal to have that included. I wrote up the thresholds, the expectations. I was able to put

together the metrics-gathering piece of how to collect data just to measure how we were doing and what we needed to focus on moving forward. Again, all that was going really well.

Then, in about a year, he left. That was gone. The whole thing fell apart. I lost my support at the executive level, which was a huge disappointment for me. So much stuff went down where the mindset of the organization really changed to where the message coming from senior leadership was “Ship, ship, ship, ship! That's all we care about. That's all we want to do. That's our main focus.”

This type of repetition, with little or no movement forward, can be traumatic to practitioners. It feels like no one is listening to you, no one trusts your knowledge or experience, and you’re starting from square one over and over again.

Ultimately, though, this repetition has nothing to do with the information itself. It has everything to do with how it’s deemed okay for organizations to ignore it. Ignoring it isn’t just allowed, it’s reinforced and rewarded because people who are in positions of power allow it to keep happening.

Nicolas Steenholt, an accessibility and inclusion speaker and trainer, told me about how telling people the same thing for decades makes him feel.

I started talking about the alt attribute back in 1994, 1995, and we’re nearly 30 years later and I still talk about that. I would like for things to move on. This has been in the accessibility

guidelines in HTML for 30 bloody years. You have no excuse to not be aware of this. This is a basic skill for your job. We as the accessibility community and the disability community, should not have to keep re-litigating the same thing over and over and over again.

An anonymous practitioner told me about how this plays out over time, and how much we could get done if we didn’t have to do it:

People joke about this, or I joke about it. It was like, “How many times can I talk about label, for, IDs, or even having a visible label with the same teams over and over?” Because I tend to be someone who enjoys progress and change and that sort of stuff, it also just became tiring.

We could be looking at maturity models, doing metrics, playing politics, but we continued having these barriers in incorporating accessibility. Then, at the end of the day, what people really wanted me to do was either audits, which I don’t think are progressive, or just telling people what to do. I think I get tired of reinventing new ways of approaching the same accessibility issues over and over. And I got tired of trying to fight the battles of standards that were relatively easy to implement functionally, like explicit labels for input fields, but only difficult to implement because of the social structures, I think, that are applied in big organizations.

This even happens in organizations dedicated to accessibility. An anonymous practitioner told me this about an experience working at an accessibility agency:

I was a huge advocate for accessible structure in documents. I felt like a broken record, going, “We need to use a heading structure [for meeting notes].” So I went through and created a template. I would say, “When you open a new document, make a copy, do this, and then just fill it out. It takes two minutes.” And they wouldn’t do it.

So they’d send me stuff and it’s all in 11 point font Calibri, and I can’t see a damn thing. So I have to go in and change everything. And I’m like, “How much of my time do you waste every day because you couldn’t be bothered to make it accessible to me, and accessible to my blind coworker?” That was a huge frustration, that even in an organization that is all about accessibility, internally they didn’t care. They couldn’t be bothered.

And that for me, was a real low point. They were sending out these PowerPoint presentations to clients which weren’t accessible. And I’m like, “How are we not doing this? We are telling them these are accessibility mistakes and we don’t even make it accessible.” They talk the talk, but they’re not walking the walk. And I’m like, “How can we expect clients to really make an effort to change, if we can’t even do that in the information that we’re giving them?”

Another factor that contributes to overly emotional labor is isolation. This can take many forms. It can mean feeling like you’re on the spot all the time, like if you don’t have a perfect answer at the drop of a hat, you’re bad at your job. 13 It can be lacking mentors and role

models, because no one else in your team or organization understands what you do. 14 It can also mean experiencing “vicarious trauma” from empathy with colleagues and customers who are experiencing trauma themselves. 15

It can also mean struggling to talk about your work with loved ones because it feels too complex or too personal to share. In a 2022 study of Korean social workers, participants reported that they had to rely on colleagues alone for support, since their families and friends didn’t really understand their work. One participant in that study said:

My family members? They don’t know much about what I do or what I experience other than, ‘Oh, you’re helping others. You are doing meaningful work for others.’ My family and friends don’t really know what I do other than I work with children. 16

To bring us back to the way that personal and professional identity are intertwined, doing “meaningful work” is often something we take personally, to the point of making it part of our personal identity. Anna E. Cook, a senior designer and accessibility and inclusive design specialist, told me about how this made dealing with burnout even harder for them.

What I’ve done so well, and this is partially to do with the fact that I have workaholic tendencies like a lot of us, I think, is I’ve made everything work.

My outlets were all work. The speaking events, the workshops, the conferences, the articles.

The identity crisis of it is really was the toughest part because, open and honest, [doing accessibility work] was my identity. Now, I deleted my Twitter and I am not taking on things like I used to. I’m like, ‘Well, who am I? What happens if I let go?’ I’m so afraid of letting go and what comes after that. What if I lose my job and then I don’t want to do it anymore, then what am I going to do? There are too many financial and social impacts related to this that make it very complicated that it’s hard to—I don’t know. I don’t know who I am without my work.

Crystal Preston-Watson, an accessibility subject matter expert, points out the tension inherent to supporting others through burnout, too:

I have told a couple of people, ‘I can’t tell you what you need to find to really make sure you don’t burn out, but you need to know that saying, “You can’t set yourself on fire to keep others warm.”

Yes, accessibility is important, but you are the most important person in your life. I have told people that, it’s like, I’m not trying to discourage you. I would love more people in accessibility, but I also want you to be healthy, as healthy as you can be in this world.

Professionalization

Professional fields usually have some sort of expectations around how workers in that field look, behave, and interact with others. “Professionalization” can include formal education, socialization, and requirements like certification.

People who have marginalized identities, including people who are disabled, can have a much harder time conforming to these expectations. c This comes from mismatches between people’s “personal identity, culture, and background” and their “professional identity. 17

On one hand, professionalization can help members of a profession get along better with clients, patients, or other professionals. On the other hand, it can create barriers for entry if marginalized people can’t meet the usually very homogenous requirements for professionalization in the first place.

This gets complicated when employers don’t know what to look for in a professional from the accessibility field.

An anonymous practitioner spoke to me about the challenges of trying to get into the field as an immigrant and as a disabled person:

I think it was hard when I came to the United States, in the beginning, finding work that paid you was a little harder than I expected. I felt it should have been slightly easier to get work, at least here, but it was hard. There was a period when, I guess self-doubt or the career path that I had taken, the doubts regarding that, had crept in. That was probably a low point in my relatively smallish accessibility career.

Natalie Patrice Tucker, an accessibility lead, told me a story about struggling to get noticed for an extremely suitable role.

I saw this gig. I read it 14 times, it was very clear that they were looking for me, specifically me. I sent my resume and said something nice. I got an immediate rejection. I was like, what? [chuckles] I was like, okay, so they must not really be serious.

Then six months later, a recruiter reached out to my mentor who referred them to me. To their credit, they came out of the gate like, “Mea culpa. We didn’t really know what we was looking for. This is the first time we’ve ever done anything like this. We went through a lot of iterations, and now we’re back to you.” [laughs] I was like, “Yes, that’ll happen.” [laughs]

There are efforts to make the digital accessibility field more professionalized with certifications. However, these currently rely on memorization and multiple-choice tests. D This can make them a barrier for people who have disabilities that impact their memory, attention, intellect, learning, and information processing. 18

Drew Herrema, an accessibility specialist and designer, told me his thoughts about certifications and professionalization:

I’m terrible with tests. Absolutely terrible with tests. It feels like most of the trouble with certifications is it’s testing my ability to do the test, not testing my ability to have the knowledge.

Education, the hiring process and certifications are all shaped by the people who get through them. That’s why I was so focused on learning more about the hiring process. Because

when I got through it, I was like, “That shouldn’t have been so hard.” Now, what can I learn? How do I fix it?

Alexis Lucio echoed what Drew had to say and added in the extra pressure to afford training, testing, and certification. They spoke in particular about the experience of people who are new to the field.

“Well, I want to learn about accessibility. Here’s this certification I can take. Holy crap, it’s $600, that’s one third of my rent.”

You could self-learn and you could have a plethora of experience but someone won’t hire you because you don’t have a capricious certification. They’re using the same mechanisms that academia does in that it’s a pay-to-play. Are you a good multiple-choice test taker? Let me tell you, I bombed so many finals and midterms in college and I wish I had enough people to tell me it doesn’t matter after a certain point. It really doesn’t.

While I do think that professionalization is important for the maturity of the field, it needs to be inclusive by default to people experiencing oppression. I’m currently afraid that we’re perpetuating the same issues that make it hard for marginalized people, including disabled people, to get professional work in the first place.

Lack of organizational support

A 2022 survey of design professionals showed that they all had “ongoing issues in their organizations, chief among them being ineffective divisions of labor, a lack of transparency and accountability from leadership, and unrealistic performance expectations.” These participants also cited issues that will be familiar to accessibility practitioners, like “having to constantly advocate for the value of their job to leadership or peers,” or trying to do “ethical research and design in a resistant organization.” 19

When I surveyed accessibility practitioners in 2022 about their work experiences, there was a similar gap in support. This gap appeared at all levels of employment, including for people who work on accessibility teams in large organizations. Nearly 40% of 442 practitioners told me they lacked buy-in from senior leadership. 29% didn’t have buy-in from colleagues, and 10% didn’t have buy-in from their managers. Nearly 45% reported lacking resources they needed to do their job. The most common issues were lack of workflows and processes, lack of time to do the work, lack of tools, and lack of headcount or budget for work. 20

For example, Susan Bustetter, an accessibility advocate at the State of Washington, told me about her efforts to establish an accessibility team:

We wrote a proposal for an Accessibility Team to include a Chief of Accessibility. Leadership requested the proposal, but then nothing came of it. They say one thing but then where’s the money and where are the resources? We’re doing it in our spare time; just people that care enough about getting it off

the ground. You have to be willing to keep asking for the same thing over and over again.

Accessibility needs to be treated the same way security is being treated right now: Where there are resources, it’s a requirement, and it’s fully funded as a priority. It’s been law since the 1990’s and we’re still just talking about it? It needs to be a priority coming from the top and then it needs to be given appropriate resources.

Alexis Lucio mentioned how this lack of support impacts us by creating roles that are far too large:

I think what makes the accessibility field even harder is that there’s so few places that offer jobs in an environment that is already safe for accessibility. There's not enough credit to the work that accessibility practitioners are doing, especially those who truly care beyond compliance. We are simultaneously doing the work and also shifting an entire company culture in an environment with a status quo to resist that. That’s like five jobs in one!

Another practitioner I spoke to described the challenges that come with being pushed into leadership roles, too.

A lot of people who get into accessibility come in through individual contributor roles [like design and development]. Then, because of their knowledge of accessibility, they get promoted to a conformance and policy role, and things like that. You’re taking someone that was very technical-minded,

writing code [for example], then you’re pushing them into middle management, sometimes VP, executive level. That’s a whole bunch of politicking there, and they don’t know what to do.

When I moved up, I knew what I was getting into. I think the reason why the burnout didn’t get to me is because I knew I was going to eventually get burnt out. I saw and curtailed it and really got through it. There’s so many people who come in and get promoted, and they’re like, “Oh, my God, execs don’t care!” It’s like, yes, that’s how they’re a VP or a C suite.

This range and scale of responsibilities makes it difficult to communicate what we’re supposed to be doing. It also makes it difficult to know how we’re supposed to grow in our careers. Just like we struggle to explain what we do to friends and family, we often can’t even explain it to colleagues. There is what we are called or what we say we do, and what we actually do. And even if you can fight to have the word "accessibility" actually appear in your title, you're still doing the work of a project or program manager on top of it.

As an example, accessibility practitioner Eric Bailey told me this about his role:

I’m an accessibility designer now and nobody knows what that is. And even with people that do it, there’s so much variety. I think nominally what I do on paper is make design more accessible. What I do in the actual is a lot of component spec writing, which is a liaison between a visual designer and an

engineer, both of which may or may not be familiar with accessibility, and then translating UI decisions into stuff that will interface with assistive technology.

Support from organizations also tends to vary depending on the times. Studies on burnout show participants reporting that “equal opportunities” dried up during downsizing, to the point of “backlash and regression” against marginalized people and inclusive ideas. 21 Work and workers are valued when it’s convenient and ignored when it’s not.

A practitioner put it very plainly:

I think a big part of [burnout] is the big corporate entity that tells you it doesn’t give a shit. It hires you specifically for the purpose of giving a shit. They really don’t. I’m going to be totally honest, I don’t think any accessibility advocate in any role has really gotten the support they need at that level to actually do what they are hired to do. Just to consistently be praised and shit on all the time is the most confusing thing. My trauma response is like, “I don’t know what we’re doing now.” You’re like, “Well, we’re going to therapy. That’s what we’re doing.”

This lack of support happens alongside larger failures.

For example, organizations typically don’t address issues that disproportionately impact marginalized groups in general. This is probably because 82% of people who work in human resources think their field “does a good job of implementing diversity-related

initiatives.” 22 But when they do implement such initiatives, their solutions can be damaging. In a study of organizational playbooks on addressing workplace trauma, researchers had this to say:

[We] found that these playbooks, frequently celebrated by organization leaders as support for employees, were just as harmful as the problems they were meant to address. They prioritized efficiency and productivity over the care of individuals.

In doing so, these playbooks exacerbated the traumatizing dynamics within organizations, contributing to a painful collective of emotional injury that builds up over time without a legitimate plan for relief in sight. 23

Many practitioners told me stories about people in organizations showing a deep-seated lack of understanding of accessibility and lack of care for disabled people. Here are a few.

Eric Bailey said:

We recently rolled out some automation that reminds people to include alt descriptions on images that they include on issues internally. And there was a huge fracas about how this was annoying and it slowed down productivity. And your average developer, I feel, will do astounding amount of mental gymnastics to avoid having to adapt to things that don’t immediately line up with things that they like.

What this implicitly communicates is blind and low vision people and neurodivergent people don’t work at [my company] because we’re not willing to expend the effort to understand why this automation exists and why it’s good to provide.

And yes, this is on the accessibility team to do some education and outreach, but also at what point do you throw up your hands and say, how do you do change management on this? How do you combat entrenched ableism that’s this deep?

Shell Little told me about fighting to keep a former employer from patenting an accessible solution for a complicated problem:

Unfortunately, because we were working so close with legal, they ended up wanting to patent our solution against my will. It felt like we were in an accessibility patent arms race. Our competitor had patented what a screen reader could say in this flow, so to protect ourselves, we had to do the same. It’s a dangerous game to play.

Trust me, I fought tooth and nail. Me getting fired was tossed around at one point because I refused to budge. I do think standing up to a lawyer in a corporate C-suite meeting is a highlight of my career. I made my case knowing he could not wrap his head around what my concerns were. He never did.

In the end they patented it without my signature, promising not to restrict other companies use of the design. I’m proud of the solution we came up with but that one really hurt. It was a reminder on how powerless we are to the machine that is a

giant corporation. That was the beginning of the end of my career in corporate.

Amy Carney, a digital accessibility specialist, told me about how organizations’ lack of understanding impacts her as a consultant:

What’s been disheartening is that despite being taken seriously as an expert, my guidance is dismissed. Issues are put into the backlog purgatory. People don’t take accessibility seriously beyond the threat of a lawsuit. Trying to get people to really want to advocate for accessibility beyond, “Okay, we need to follow WCAG.” Then what?

I think most experts try to go, “It starts with awareness and getting people on baseline. Let’s get everybody through training.”

“Oh, no, let’s just get an audit and get this stuff fixed.”

It’s like you’re not really understanding why you’re failing.

Anna E. Cook summed up the feeling of pushing against such odds:

I think it’s just hard to have to celebrate the smallest victories when you know there’s so much more that you wish you could do. And that will inevitably, if it happens, take years and years of pushing and advocating. That’s just the nature of accessibility no matter where you’re at, I think.

Idealism

Personal investment and idealism contribute to burnout too. When we realize that we are wrecking ourselves to do important work that is not a priority for the organizations we serve, we experience grief. This was a topic of Herbert J. Freudenberger’s 1974 article “Staff Burn-Out,” which was written about mental health practitioners working in a free clinic. Freudenberger wrote:

If your idealism, the very motivation that led you to come into an institution...has been lost, then the burn-out has also within it the dynamics of mourning. Something has died. There has been a real loss...You will then need time to replenish that loss, to find new good people to surround yourself with, new activities to give you gratification. Such a burn-out is difficult to overcome because it has been made even more complicated by adding to exhaustion both grief over the loss of your ideals and anger, which is always present after grief. 24

This is a danger for us too. Accessibility practitioners moralize and personally identify with our work. In my survey, 93.8% of respondents chose “It’s morally the right thing to do” from a list of options. 25 WebAIM’s 2021 accessibility practitioner survey, which had 758 responses, had 86% of respondents choose “Moral motivation (it’s the right thing to do).” 26 It’s this belief that fuels many of us to keep doing this work. It makes us feel personally invested. It makes us feel that our work aligns with our ideals. It makes us feel personally responsible, even as we are trying to undo something—systemic ableism—that is much bigger than one person.

An anonymous practitioner told me this about the way that organizations prey on our investment:

This continuously kicks my ass: Accessibility is, on paper, a company priority. It is never vocalized or pointed to or given the resourcing that it needs in the company communication, in the company policy and actual practice. Everybody thinks accessibility is the right thing to do, but nobody will commit to doing it. It’s easy to crank out an inspiration porn blog post, but when it comes time to spend money and allocate resources, it is very conveniently not a priority.

Shell Little told me about the pressure they put on themself to stay in a successful program, worried about never getting the kind of buy-in they’d achieved again.

It's not accessibility, it's not the job, it's not working for disabled people, it's not learning standards, it's not researching and trying your best. The downsides oftentimes come with the bullshit that comes with being in accessibility in a company. Dealing with your managers who see you as a pest, upper managers who only care about risk, your PM not letting you make any meaningful change, it's the designer who fights you for no reason, it's proving you have to be there over and over. It's not the job. It's the environment we're forced to work in that really breaks the spirit.

I’m lucky because near the end of my stint in corporate, everybody including designers and developers were so competent with accessibility that I got to say, don't call me for

color contrast, don't bother me for labels, don't talk to me about the basic stuff because someone else knows the answer. Before I left, my role was ‘only call me in for the really, really hard stuff’. It was thrilling working on the hard stuff, but also soul crushing. I was on an island by myself. I missed working as a team and having a group of people all working towards the same goal.

On top of never thinking I can work in corporate again, I worry if I do, I'll never get that again. I think that's a big reason why I stayed longer than I should have at my last job. I don't know if I'm ever going to have that much buy-in, that much power, that much success in an org again. It took me over five years, but I fostered a really strong community and everybody understood the importance of accessibility. People cared and they wanted to learn and they wanted to get better. They wanted to be known as a person who could step up for accessibility. That’s unfortunately way too rare in the accessibility spaces.

This personal dedication can extend into managing other specialists too. Allie Thu, who leads a team of accessibility designers, told me:

One of the hardest things I found to manage around? People’s emotions and passion and the way that they wrap the morality of this work into their purpose and identity. I’ve talked to my other manager friends that do not work in this space whatsoever. I’ve tried to explain it’s just a different beast.

There’s so much more on the line: Truly people’s independence, self-worth, equality.

Another practitioner described losing their idealism in pieces at different roles over the years:

When my current company reached out to me, I was already making moves to leave tech. I was fucking done. Fucking done. I was like, I love my work and I can’t do this anymore. The place that I was working was so horrifyingly toxic that I was having weekly screaming matches with my lead about the work. I had essentially been hired as legal cover and was not allowed to do any work. It was bad. It was really, really, awfully, horrifyingly bad.

It wasn’t just that company. Some of the places I most wanted to work. It was heartbreaking.

I took some time before starting my current job. It was then that I realized that there's another way but it wasn't until like a year into being here that my nervous system had really reset, that I could contribute without flinching in particular ways.

Healing ourselves

EJ Mason summarized a common thread in my interviews:

I wouldn't say this is a cure-all because there's no cure for burnout. You become a new person with the burnout attached. I had this huge aha moment where I was like, "Oh, me caring

is not the problem." That was a healing aspect of getting over my burnout. The solution is not to stop caring.

An inescapable theme in all the interviews and scholarly literature was the fact that we don’t burn out over the actual work itself. We burn out over:

How our identities (often as disabled, queer, racialized, and otherwise othered people) are challenged and questioned

How our profession is poorly understood and often exploitative

How our idealism is a double-edged sword

We burn out over defending the work. We burn out over having to ask permission over and over again. We burn out when we’re not allowed to just do our jobs. And yes, this is complicated too. Advocacy is part of the work. Getting buy-in is part of the work. But it can’t be all of the work, or we’ll burn ourselves alive.

I realized while I did the research and interviews for this book that none of those things are our problems. They’re other people’s problems, which they impose on us. We shouldn’t be ashamed of ourselves, what we do, how we do it, and how much we care about it. We’re not the cause of our burnout. Systemic failures are. And accepting this made it a lot easier to heal.

When I asked interviewees about their healing journeys, some folks were still deep in burnout. The people who reported some progress reflected on things they did to reconnect with themselves. These ranged from exercise to making art to playing games with friends.

Practitioners told me with smiles about their photography, their growing collections of tabletop game miniatures, and their habits of listening to audiobooks and taking walks.

There was a lot of therapy, sure, but there was a lot of just letting themselves to be creative and restful.

I like to think that everyone came to the same conclusion in their own way, that burnout is not our fault. The things that make you yourself—what you care about and what brings you joy—are a lifeline to moving forward.

Chapter summary

Burnout is a complex feeling of distance and lack of motivation that can impact all parts of our lives. We can get burnout from multiple sources, including work, our personal lives, and conditions in society.

People with marginalized identities and people who work in helping professions like accessibility are at more risk for work burnout. This includes disabled workers, who often struggle to find suitable work and stay in jobs that aren’t a good fit out of necessity.

Major factors for burnout include emotional labor, how a field handles professionalization, lack of support in organizations, and our own idealism. These factors, along with many others and our own individual identities, create a complex web of burnout that accessibility practitioners are especially prey to.

To do this work safely and for the long term, we need to work to reduce and prevent burnout by focusing on what we can control in our jobs and protecting ourselves against the rest.

A. People in this work come from all backgrounds and do everything you can possibly think of. To that end, the people I spoke with are designers, engineers, conference speakers, team leads, program managers, consultants, subject matter experts, and interns. They are writers, artists, activists, parents, partners, and hobbyists of all kinds. They have varying ages, identities, education levels, and years in the field. Most are disabled and/or neurodivergent. They work or worked in agencies, product companies, big tech, government, and as solo practitioners.

Chapter 2: Education and literacy

Nicolas Steenholt: Computer science programs and boot camps are really bad [about teaching accessibility]. There's a few that try to do a little bit of that teaching. Maybe they get two or three hours on accessibility and HTML and semantics over a six-week period. Someone who is trying to learn actually is never really exposed to that until they face somebody like you, somebody like me.

What you’ll read: When people come to do accessibility work, they often teach and mentor. By the end of this chapter, you’ll be more familiar with a few theories about how people learn, how they seek and evaluate information, and how this impacts them as people.

Instructional design

Instructional design is the practice of designing teaching materials and learning experiences. It’s built on the idea that how people learn has a huge impact on how they retain and apply knowledge, so being thoughtful about instructional materials is important.

There are many theories of instructional design, but I’m going to focus on three related topics: Learning styles, adult education, and

Constructivism.

Learning styles

Different people have different learning styles. The original style categories are visual, auditory, and tactile. 1 These come from traditional classroom settings with children. This means that some students will learn best by observing the teacher do something: complete a task, write on the board, show a video. Other students will learn best by attending a lecture, listening to a recording, or hearing a book read to them. And others will learn best by touch, either literally by holding and interacting with objects or by doing a task themselves. Basically, different people absorb information best through different senses and in different settings.

Obviously, these specific categories won't work for everyone. But, they can be used more broadly. Here are some examples of how these styles can apply to accessibility education:

A product owner learns about accessibility laws by watching videos and reviewing transcripts on YouTube.

A front-end engineer learns about disability justice by listening to podcasts of interviews with disabled people talking about their activism.

A designer learns about assistive technology by participating in a usability session with a person who has multiple sclerosis and uses a switch device with their phone.

The way you think about and deliver education will need to be adaptive. People are wired to learn in different ways, regardless of age, disability, and other factors, and you will have to use different teaching methods before things stick.

Education might take the form of dispensing little nuggets of information in a Teams channel. It might mean getting 6 minutes to talk during an all-hands call. It might mean collaborating with a team on a project. Or it might mean helping a person you’re mentoring grow their accessibility knowledge one-on-one.

You’ll need to be comfortable with delivering the same information in multiple ways for different people in different situations, within reason. We’ll talk about reusing and repackaging information in more detail in Chapter 9: Communication and coalition.

Adult education

Separate from learning styles, teaching (most) adults is different than teaching (most) children. Adult brains are less elastic than child brains, and adults are more set in their ways.

Adults also tend to expect what they are learning to be useful right away. This is for practical reasons. Often, adults are immediately looking for how “this” applies to “them.” This isn’t just because they are only half paying attention during your workshop. It’s because adult brains are much better at retaining knowledge that can be tied to something they already know.

Adults also have more life experience and knowledge than children do. They are trying to shove any new information in the nooks and crannies of what’s already in there. Since they are short on brain space, and usually time, they want to decide for themselves what is important to learn, and they need to do some exploration on their own to help inform that decision. 2

Deciding what’s worth learning also extends to deciding what’s worth remembering and acting on. In addition to just having more knowledge, adults also have fixed viewpoints and values that they’ve developed over time. This means that they validate any new information they are given against their existing beliefs and experiences. A

Adult educators sometimes use an acronym, SMART, to keep track of these moving parts. 3 SMART means:

Specific

Measurable

Achievable

Relevant

Timebound

Here’s an example. Say you’re tasked with teaching a product team about accessibility. The team’s product owner tells you that the online training the teams get isn’t “enough.” They’re struggling with what to actually do and where to start with what they learn. They also

can’t commit to any intensive, required workshops or classes, because they’ve got deadlines!

From the product owner, you’ve learned that the team is looking for training that is more specific to what they do as a team. The general training that everyone gets isn’t cutting it. Their learning needs to be more relevant to what they’re actually working on.

To sell the training, the team members need to know what they’re supposed to achieve by attending. 4 They also need to know what they’re supposed to try to achieve in their own work. How can they tell if they’re doing enough? How can they measure whether they’re doing a good job or not?

And finally, you’ve got some time limitations. It will be helpful for the teams to know that their time commitment is limited. The training should be timebound: they should know up front how long it is, and that it won't run over.

You’ll also probably want to be flexible on attendance. If folks can’t attend, how can they access the information? Will you record the training? Make a resource guide with activities? Run the session multiple times? All of these are options you can consider. C

Constructivism

Constructivism is the theory that knowledge is constructed. 5 Saying “knowledge is a human construct” isn’t a metaphor. We actively build knowledge in ourselves and in our communities and societies through learning and experience.

In addition to “Knowledge is constructed,” there are a few more principles that I want to mention. These principles are the “why” behind a lot of practical instructional design advice. c

Learning relies on making (literally constructing) meaning. It also relies on making systems of meaning. When you learn something new, it’s helpful to learn what it means in context.

For example, imagine I am teaching someone about a specific type of assistive technology. It would help for that person to learn what types of people uses that assistive tech and why. This puts the tech itself (its meaning) into the context of why it exists, who uses it, and why it works the way it does (its system of meaning).

Learning is an active process that the learner is constantly engaged in. Learning is not a one-time event. People will continue to accrue and process new information for the rest of their lives. Learning doesn’t stop when a person leaves a webinar. It stops when they’re dead.

Learning is a social activity. It can bridge across different individuals at different stages of the learning process. Even if you aren’t teaching people in a group, it can be helpful to give people space to share their knowledge with each other.

This is why study groups and other forms of social learning are so helpful. The aha moments in these settings are often spontaneous and communal, which makes them stick better.

Learning happens in the context of what a person already knows and what they need to know. This goes back to the idea of putting information in context. People often don’t know what they don’t know. They may try to learn something without having needed vocabulary and context. They’ll struggle without knowing why.

Presenting information so that people can find that context right away is key. This is why skills like knowledge management, which we’ll talk about more in the next few chapters, are so important to scaling learning.

Knowledge is personal. It’s going to impact you individually, and may change your values, whether you realize it or not. This is especially important for teaching people about accessibility, disability, ableism, and oppression. It’s why teaching these topics can be so difficult. It’s why people might be deeply moved or deeply resistant. People have fixed ideas that they use to navigate the world. By doing this work, you are often turning some of those ideas upside down.

Motivation is key to learning. This might be obvious, but if someone doesn’t want to learn something, they probably won’t. If someone is unmotivated and resistant to learn, there’s a reason why, and they might not know that reason themselves.

This gets extra hard when you’re dealing with information that has such an intensely personal impact. When you get strong pushback, it might be best to focus on teaching others for a while.

In general, Constructivism tells us that educating people is a messy, ongoing business full of shifts of perspective. It also tells us that learning is participatory. For learning to happen, there must be active work put in by both the instructor and the student.

Above all, Constructivism says that learning should be led by the learner, which can be stressful for people that benefit from a more traditional learning process. Some learners will benefit from traditional learning methods (webinars, workshops, tutorials) and others will want to strike out on their own. One of your challenges is designing education for both.

Information literacy

In the previous section, hopefully you took away the idea that a lot of learning is about discovering what you do and don’t know in context. When a concept or idea is new, it’s harder to ask the right questions to learn more. And this is on top of our inelastic adult brains making it harder to learn in the first place! So, an important part of teaching people new information is helping them to understand the skills they need to find and evaluate information on their own. This is where information literacy comes in.

Information needs and information literacy

Information literacy is the skill people need to find, evaluate, and use information effectively. The more skilled you are at asking and answering these questions, the more information literacy you have.

The formal definition of information literacy is “a set of abilities requiring individuals to ‘recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information.’” 6 Librarians use this concept to help meet library patrons where they are in their research.

This process begins with having an information need. The information need is a catalyst for doing research in the first place. Once you have some resources, you then ask questions to see if they fit your need and to understand their biases. The types of questions you might ask about resources include:

When and where is it from?

Why was it made?

Who made it?

In what context was it made?

Who benefits from it?

A framework for information literacy

These questions are part of a formal framework developed by the Association of College & Research Libraries. The purpose of the framework is to identify what a person’s information literacy level is, which impacts how a librarian will work with them.

The framework has six “frames,” which will seem very familiar after what you’ve read about Constructivism. These frames are the categories or topics that the system is built around, where a person

will have reached a certain stage or level in each frame. The frames are:

Authority Is Constructed and Contextual. Whether someone knows what they’re talking about depends on who they are and the context of their information.

Information Creation as a Process. How something is made impacts the thing itself.

Information Has Value.

Research as Inquiry. That is, research is a part of a process that makes the person question their world.

Scholarship as Conversation. Information from different sources on the same topic is in discussion with each other and impacts each other.

Searching as Strategic Exploration. There is a purpose to doing research. It’s not just a random activity. 7

If you’re thinking these frames are very similar to the principles of Constructivism we just discussed, you’re extremely right. Information literacy is an example of the Constructivist idea that learners and teachers (in this case, librarians) are actively engaged in learning as a process. It’s basically “teach a man to fish” for librarians. The goal isn’t to make people experts in the field they’re researching. Instead, the goal is to give them the skills they need to engage meaningfully with the process of learning and become better researchers as a result.

In a practical sense, teaching everyone some information literacy means that people can solve a lot of problems on their own. It allows people autonomy in the learning process and gives librarians and other specialists more time to work on complex projects.

Information literacy is a huge part of teaching people about accessibility. So much so, I’ve written a whole chapter about it, with a framework you can use in your practice, which we’ll get into next.

Chapter summary

Instructional design is the practice of designing and creating educational material. Different people have different learning styles. These relate to how people take in information with their senses and process it for themselves.

When you are creating training for adults, it’s important to make the information relevant to their work or day-to-day lives.

All of these concepts tie into the philosophy of Constructivism. Constructivism says that people build knowledge in their minds by actively engaging with what they are learning.

Constructivism relates to information literacy too. Information literacy is the skill to define an information need and evaluate resources to meet that need. Librarians made a framework that they can use to measure peoples’ information literacy. Having more information literacy means being able to meet your own information needs better.

Chapter 3: Accessibility literacy

Interviewee: We need a lot of people to know a little bit of the basics so specialists can do special work.

What you’ll read. By the end of this chapter, you’ll be familiar with a tool you can use to measure individuals’ information literacy about accessibility.

When I first started thinking seriously about how to teach accessibility, I found myself returning to information literacy again and again. I’d been doing this in my head for years but hadn’t really pieced together why or how.

I ran with this idea for a talk called “Designing Accessibility Education in Organizations” that I gave at the Accessibility Toronto Conference in 2019. 1 I coined the term “accessibility literacy” then, and the label has stuck for me. Since then, I’ve developed the Accessibility Literacy Framework (ALF).

What this tool is

I based ALF on my experience using the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education. 2 As a Constructivist framework, ALF is intended to help you understand how engaged people are in their own accessibility learning and practice. Having that knowledge will

make it easier to engage with them on this topic and should give you some clues about how you can best support them.

With that information, you can:

Ĉ. Identify what stage a person is in on their accessibility literacy journey

ĉ. Identify gaps between their current stage and the next stage

Ċ. Develop a plan to move the individual from the current stage to the next stage

If you do this for multiple individuals, you can start to build out a model of accessibility literacy at scale. You can use that information to get a sense for the literacy of a whole team, or a whole organization. You can then take this information into account as you make decisions about your program.

What this tool isn’t

ALF is not a tool for measuring expertise. We don’t need to make more accessibility experts. What we need is for non-experts to get better at integrating accessibility information and literacy into their work. We need them to be able to make informed decisions without the constant intervention of an accessibility practitioner.

Frames

ALF has five frames, or categories. They capture different facets of how accessibility literacy fits into people’s work. You can use fewer

or more frames or make your own to fit your needs. The frames are (in no particular order):

Guidelines and practices Authority Tools and resources Information seeking Anti-ableism

Figure 1. A round robin of the five frames of accessibility literacy.

Let’s go through each of the frames in more detail.

Guidelines and practices

How familiar is a person with the accessibility guidelines and practices that impact their work and organization? Can they:

Find the guidelines and practices that affect their role and responsibilities Evaluate which guidelines and practices are appropriate for a given feature or project Use guidelines and practices effectively in their work

Authority

How does a person seek help from authorities in the field? How do they decide who is an authority? How do they consider authorities’ work? How do they consider an authority’s expertise? Can a person:

Find information from authorities in the field Evaluate their authority and understand their experiences and motives Use information from authorities effectively

Tools and resources

How familiar is a person with the accessibility tools and resources in their organization? Can they:

Find accessibility tools and resources for their role Evaluate what tools and resources are appropriate for a given feature or project Use tools and resources effectively in their work

Information seeking

Knowing how people do their own research is critical to understanding what decisions they are going to make. How does a person do at their own accessibility research? How skilled are they to:

Develop relevant research questions

Evaluate and adjust their process as they learn new information

Know when they have enough information to make a decision

Anti-ableism

How aware is a person of ableism and its impacts? A Can they:

Understand how ableism intersects with other axes of oppression

Evaluate biases about ableism, accessibility, and disability (including their own)

Use their accessibility literacy skills to do anti-ableist work

Stages

There are four stages of accessibility literacy. Each has a general theme or focus.

Figure 2. The four stages of accessibility literacy and their themes.

None

The first stage of accessibility literacy is “none.” This is most people’s starting point when they haven’t actively engaged in accessibility work, or other anti-ableist work. This isn’t a value judgment; it’s just that most people haven’t. People with no literacy don’t know the correct place to start. It’s difficult to move forward when you don’t know what you’re missing. Hopefully, these folks reach out for help. Sometimes, though, they go down a rabbit hole on their own and get a very strange idea of how something works.

Low

The next stage of accessibility literacy, “Low,” often focuses on vocabulary. This allows individuals to research and communicate. It helps people search more effectively, especially when search results are increasingly AI-generated hot garbage.

This is also the level where people get some introductory knowledge about and awareness of accessibility. It’s learning about things like common types of assistive technology, what a focus outline is, what the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) include, and the like.

Remember that literacy isn’t just about awareness. It is also about action, so there is a strong focus on how people use their new knowledge. We want people to start to use their knowledge in ways that are safe and productive for them and the people they are trying to support.

Medium

The next stage, “Medium,” is about helping people get more comfortable with vetting trustworthy sources and authorities. This allows individuals to do their own research without the direct help of an accessibility specialist, or someone else with more accessibility knowledge.

Depending on the context, examples of trustworthy sources could be Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) specifications, books, journals,

news articles, blog posts, forum posts, GitHub discussions, and social media posts by disabled people and accessibility practitioners.

Understanding authority also requires some discernment. Not all types of authority are equal. For example, I would put more stock in a blog post that a disabled person writes about a problem in an assistive technology they use than a glowing press release by the tool’s vendor. The vendor is an authority on the product, but not in the same way that a user is of their experience.

At this stage, people need to learn how to get plugged into the conversations happening every day about accessibility and disabled peoples’ lives. They need to understand how to evaluate bias, check dates, interpret recommendations and guidelines, and understand context.

High

The final stage, “High,” involves understanding nuance in the accessibility space. After someone has a good grasp on how to evaluate resources and back up their decision-making, they may be ready to start leading accessibility discussions in their organization. To do this effectively, people need to be able to grasp the difference between “can” and “should” when it comes to making decisions that impact the accessibility of a product or service.

This is the difference between accessibility as compliance and accessibility as usability, where a compliant product may pass automated and manual testing with flying colors but fall short for

actual disabled users. Understanding this nuance means an individual can be trusted to do a lot of work on their own.

Framing the stages

Now let’s put the frames and the stages together with some criteria. Each stage has criteria for each frame. A person

with a low level of literacy will not be as advanced as a person with a medium level of literacy, and so on.

ALF isn’t all or nothing within each frame, either. Functionally, ALF is a group of sliding scales or spectrums. Someone might have higher literacy in one frame than other, just like a person “on the spectrum” might have different levels of need in different areas of their life.

A way I like to picture this is with a spider graph (which are also known as spider charts or radar charts, since they resemble a radar screen). C Spider graphs can capture when something has multiple values at the same time. If you’re a visual person or need to convey information to visual people, they are useful for showing complexity in a compact package.

Figure 3. A spider graph showing the five frames and four stages of accessibility literacy.

Now let’s get into framing criteria for each of the stages.

Going up a level

The specific things you do to help individuals raise their accessibility literacy level will vary depending on what resources you have and what you have time to do. Whatever your bandwidth is, a nice thing about a framework is that it has goals built in. Any time you can assign a certain level in the framework, you can use the guidelines or requirements for the next level as your next targets. Then, you can use the resources and services at your disposal to help get people there.

Examples

Here are some examples of using ALF. (You’ll find another set of examples in Chapter 8: A traditional accessibility program case study, too.)

Donna

Donna is a Junior Front-End Engineer who started at your company within the last month. She is a recent developer bootcamp graduate, and her bootcamp did not discuss accessibility. She previously worked as a back-end engineer, so she has a lot of technical expertise, but working on user-facing interfaces is all new to her.

She is wrapping up her first project for her team. She was given a checklist to test for accessibility, including doing manual testing with a screen reader. Her manager realizes she’s struggling with the task and recommends that she comes to your office hours. When you meet, she seems very frustrated that the screen reader she is

testing with is not reading all the page content she thinks it should be.

You have her demonstrate what she is trying to test. As she does, you see that she’s navigating only with the Tab key, which is, as expected, skipping headings, text, and images.

As you talk more, you notice that Donna doesn’t really understand what screen readers are for. She also isn’t familiar with WCAG or other accessibility guidelines, and she doesn’t really grasp semantic HTML. Together, all of this is making it very difficult for Donna to understand what she’s supposed to do and why she’s struggling to do it.

So, you show Donna the keys and gestures to read content with her screen reader, which clears up her immediate problem. You also point out where she can look this information up later if she forgets. You also share your organization’s component library documentation, which includes a whole overview of accessibility and documentation for individual components.

Based on what we know about Donna, what can we tell about her accessibility literacy?

In this case, the task Donna is trying to accomplish (manual testing with assistive technology) is pretty far away from what she knows. She didn’t know what resources are available to help her learn about this type of testing. She doesn’t appear to have the skills and knowledge she needs to find and evaluate information at her disposal.

To help Donna grow in this area, the next steps should be to target more criteria for the Low stage. You can help her become more familiar with the standards, as well as the resources and tools you have in your organization. You can also share introductory level materials about ableism and disability with her.

Ali

Ali is a UX designer with coding experience. They’ve taken online courses about accessibility and have also attended some of your workshops on how disability intersects with inclusivity. They’re using Figma to make prototypes and annotations and are contributing to the spec for the project they’re working on. They message you with some questions about WCAG and to ask you to do a review of their design and annotations.

They share the resources they used to make their decisions and guide you through their decision-making process. They seem nervous about their decision-making but can explain their reasoning. They ask for confirmation that their decisions are the “right” ones before they start building their prototype.

As you talk more, you notice that Ali:

Has done a lot of research using resources you’ve provided internally, as well as reputable resources online.

Has a strong grasp of using the accessibility tools at their disposal to work on their team’s features.

Is making good decisions but lacks the experience and confidence to believe fully in their decision-making.

Based on what we know about Ali, what can we tell about their accessibility literacy?

What Ali really needs is encouragement that they have made good decisions and that they are documenting those decisions clearly for

their team. They know more than they think, but they are struggling with adapting the information they have.

Medium. Asks more focused questions but is usually still some distance from the information goal. Knows to expect that seemingly simple questions will often not have simple answers. Can draw reasonable conclusions but may still seek experts’ confirmation that their thinking is sound.

Medium. Is more aware of personal biases and worldviews in relation to accessibility and disability. Understands that people (including disabled people) act on their own biases and assumptions about disability and accessibility. Understands that usability is a major component of accessibility.

To help Ali grow, the next steps would be to shore up their lower ratings. In their case, you could focus on going deeper into the guidelines and helping them to trust their instincts.

Janelle

Janelle is a UX Writer. You know her because she is also an accessibility champion for her team and is deeply involved in your company’s employee resource groups (ERGs) for disabled employees

and BIPOC employees. Last month she contributed to a cross-ERG workshop on unlearning cultural biases about disability. She leads discussions about accessibility and inclusivity on her team.

Janelle is working on documentation for your organization’s content style guide. Specifically, she is exploring how she should recommend that content strategists define acronyms and jargon in the product. She has questions about the pros and cons of citing WCAG level AAA success criteria versus treating this as a usability issue that can be tied into a larger discussion about inclusivity. She’s asking a few people in the organization and wants your feedback.

As you talk more, you notice that Janelle:

Is adapting and contributing her own knowledge to others in her discipline.

Is thinking about the possible impacts of her decisions on many teams in a nuanced and mature way.

Truly understands the difference between calling something an accessibility requirement versus a usability best practice.

Based on what we know about Janelle, what can we tell about her accessibility literacy?

Instead of trying to solve a specific problem, Janelle is trying to determine how to adapt her knowledge to guidelines that can help not just her team, but all teams that use the style guide. And she is

thinking about this from multiple angles at once, inclusive of her knowledge and experience.

Chapter summary

The Accessibility Literacy Framework (ALF) is a tool for evaluating people’s accessibility literacy. It helps practitioners to measure people’s ability to find, evaluate, and use information related to accessibility work. It has four stages of literacy (None, Low, Medium, and High) and includes five frames (Guidelines and practices, Authority, Tools and resources, Information seeking, and Antiableism).

Chapter 4: Organizations

Interviewee: I got tired of trying to fight the battles of standards that were relatively easy to implement but difficult to implement because of the social structures that are applied in big organizations.

What you’ll read: In this chapter, you’ll learn theories about how organizations function and mature, how power and resources flow inside them, and about helping organizations to change.

A large part of accessibility work is fighting against the ingrained culture that devalues it. This is the case even if accessibility is on paper as part of an organization’s values. As a result, understanding how organizations operate and grow is critical. To address this, I’m going to talk about a few major parts of organizational theory: maturity, culture, climate, and power, and change management.

Maturity

Accessibility maturity is a model for organizations to measure where they are on their accessibility journey. But before we talk about accessibility maturity, we need to talk about organizational maturity. And before that, we need to talk about continuous improvement.

Continuous improvement

Continuous improvement is about processes with expected results, usually processes to manufacture and distribute products. It’s a philosophy that says we should gradually improve a process by doing work, taking feedback on it, and then doing that work again with our new information, over and over again. A Those improvements might be small and conservative or large and radical. The goal is to make the process more efficient and effective while still producing the expected result.

Efficiency and effectiveness

Sometimes people talk about using continuous improvement to make things better, which is something I want to avoid here. Whether something is “better” or not will depend greatly on who you are and where you are in the system that is undergoing improvement.

It’s much more accurate to say “effective and efficient” because continuous improvement is morally gray. It’s about changing a system to make an expected result with less effort and less friction. If an organization takes on a continuous improvement project, it’s to make and deliver their product more efficiently and effectively. It’s not necessarily “better” for the people involved.

An example of a time I misunderstood this

For two years in the early 2000s, one of my jobs was to onboard non-profits onto a new database system. These organizations served unhoused people in the county where I lived. The database system

was a new federal requirement from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and state and local governments followed suit. To get their funding, non-profits needed to get on this system. Local governments got grant funding to hire people like me to help.

In the day to day, the job was to meet with the non-profits, learn about their data needs, review their intake forms, make them each a custom UI in the new system, and to make sure their reporting was correct at the end of the fiscal year. My manager, who was also an information science nerd, was hopeful that we’d be able to deduplicate records and get a more accurate count of how many people in the area were unhoused, as well as more accurate demographics for them.

Fresh from information science school, I took this on as my moral duty. I had the chance to help non-profits generate solid data that showed who the housing crisis was impacting. How children entered the system with their parents, stayed in it as teens, and often continued in it as adults. How the agency that focused on permanent supportive housing had the best outcomes with clients, and so on. We had such an opportunity!

Once every agency was onboarded and everyone’s data was entered, we had a meeting. When we proudly reported our new, lower, more accurate total count of people in the system, some agency representatives were irate. “This means we’re going to get less funding!” one person exclaimed. “I knew this database was a

mistake,” said another. “We’re going to have to re-enter our old records to get the right number.”

Remember, the goal of this improvement project wasn’t to get a better idea of who the non-profits were serving. The goal was for the non-profits to get their funding. Which, I learned that day, was functionally a bounty system based on the number of individual people they served each year.

So, continuous improvement doesn’t necessarily make things better. It makes them different in the service of a goal. And when an organization is using continuous improvement, it often figures in to a larger effort to measure and mature the organization. This is where maturity models come in.

Maturity models

A maturity model has maturity levels or stages. Each stage represents a benchmark of improvement. Each stage also corresponds to certain criteria, or proof points. These are the pieces of evidence you need to help you determine what stage a program is in.

One of the most common types of evidence for maturity is continuous improvement. The idea is that if an organization is doing continuous improvement on a process, they must already be pretty good at that process. Good enough, at least, that they can start to focus on refinement instead of just doing the basics or bare minimum of requirements.

Figure 7: A very simple example of a maturity model with three phases.

You can think of a maturity model as a lens for looking at how mature an organization is at a point in time. You can even start thinking about maturity at the beginning of your work. This gives you a framework for capturing information about what you’re doing from the very start.

Depending on the complexity of the maturity model, the criteria might be organized into categories or dimensions. For example, an organization might score high in one category and not another, which will impact its overall maturity rating. This is just like how the

information literacy and accessibility framework models I introduced in previous chapters capture different scores in different frames.

Figure 8: A spider graph showing ratings of four example dimensions of maturity: communication, training, technology, and culture.

A maturity model primarily helps you do three things:

Ĉ. Identify the organization’s current stage of maturity

ĉ. Identify gaps between the current stage and the next stage

Ċ. Develop a plan to move the organization from the current stage to the next stage

All of this information gives us solid data to use to answer questions like, “How well are we doing at X compared to Y?” and “What do we have to do next to keep making Y better?”

Measuring accessibility maturity

To measure how an organization is doing at accessibility, we can use an accessibility maturity model.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published a draft Accessibility Maturity Model that you can use or customize. 1 Alternately, if your organization already uses a maturity model to measure something else, you could potentially leverage that model. Several organizations have published their take on this model, too, so those are an option as well. I’ve included a few in the resources for this chapter.

For the purposes of this book, I’ll be using the W3C’s draft accessibility maturity model. It currently has four stages:

Ĉ. Inactive, where there is no recognition of the need for accessibility

ĉ. Launch, where there is some awareness and the beginning of planning around accessibility

Ċ. Integrate, where there is an organized approach and a roadmap

ċ. Optimize, where the organization is wholly on board and now focusing on continuous improvement 2

It also has several dimensions or categories of criteria, which you might use to evaluate different kinds of services and supports you provide in a program, or that happen in other parts of the organization:

Communications

Knowledge and skills

Support

Product development life cycle

Personnel

Procurement

Culture

In Chapter 8: A traditional accessibility program case study, I provide an example of using the W3C’s accessibility maturity model to evaluate an organization.

Culture, climate, and power

There is no way for me to distill this part of organizational theory in one section of one chapter. But the main points I want to bring across are these:

Organizations are impacted by both their culture, which is driven by a minority in leadership, and their climate, which is driven by the majority of people at the organization.

Resources, support, and information flow through organizations along power lines.

Let’s talk about both in more detail.

Culture and climate

Organizational culture and climate are different ways of framing the organization’s values and ideas. Organizational culture is formal and systemic. Organizational climate is informal, a kind of “shared perception” of the organization’s actual day-to-day. 3

People in official leadership roles create an organization’s culture. They communicate this culture to other members of the organization through management. Culture goes beyond behavior. It’s the official stance of the organization. A mission statement is an official document that represents an organization’s culture, for example. Culture in organizations is perpetuated in the same way it is in the larger culture, with ceremonies and rituals (meetings, events) and institutional myths (stories) driven by leadership. 4

In “The Concept of Organizational Culture: Why Bother?” Edgar H. Schein writes:

Culture and leadership are two sides of the same coin, in that leaders first create cultures when they create groups and organizations. Once cultures exist, they determine the criteria

for leadership and thus determine who will or will not be a leader. 5

In the same passage, Schein also writes:

[It] is the unique function of leadership to be able to perceive the functional and dysfunctional elements of the existing culture and to manage cultural evolution and change in such a way that the group can survive in a changing environment.

I might be editorializing, but I like to read this very literally. C I don’t think Schein is saying that leaders always notice dysfunction or manage change, but that they are in the unique position to be able to do so. With the “two sides of the same coin” analogy, I think he was also commenting on how leaders are also in the unique position to just perpetuate whatever weird bullshit they have going on, impacting workers as a result.

Climate, in comparison to culture, is less official. It’s a vibe. It’s the feel of the organization, how structured or loosey-goosey it is. It’s how much freedom workers really have, and how much actual support they have from leadership to try new things or make the workplace better. It’s whether you’re actually allowed to turn down a meeting your director schedules on a “No Meeting Wednesday.” Large organizations might have lots of different climates too, depending on the department or team. This plays out at a lot of large tech companies, where each division or product group is so big that it’s basically its own country with its own language, rituals, and values.

Culture and climate impact each other. It might be obvious that culture can push down on climate, but climate can also push up on culture. An example of culture impacting climate is an organization requiring workers to return to corporate offices with the supposed end of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite public opinion and scientific data supporting the positives of working from home. 6 An example of climate impacting culture is the wave of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts that happened because of Black workers’ need to hold space around ongoing and escalating police brutality. 7

The way that culture and climate can push each other is a form of power, so let’s talk about that.

Power lines

Just like electricity flows through literal power lines, resources and information move around organizations through channels and connections.

Rosabeth Moss Kanter describes the things that move through power lines as supply, information, and support. 8 Supply refers to bringing resources to places that need them. Information that travels these lines can be formal or informal, relating to culture or climate, and informs how people work. And support refers to having the backing needed to take risks or make changes without seeking formal approval.

In an organization, power lines are usually connected to people like managers who represent their teams or departments. However, Kanter also calls out specialists (what she calls “staff professionals”

or “staff specialists”) as people who become conduits for these types of lines, too. These are people we’d often call subject matter experts (SMEs) or subject matter specialists today.

As advisers behind the scenes, staff people must sell their programs and bargain for resources, but unless they get themselves entrenched in organizational power networks, they have little in the way of favors to exchange. They are seen as useful adjuncts to the primary tasks of the organization but inessential in a day-to-day operating sense. 9

Kanter also has something to say about how SMEs can sometimes fumble this, turning themselves into bottlenecks:

Staff people tend to act out their powerlessness by becoming turf-minded. They create islands within the organization. They set themselves up as the only ones who can control professional standards and judge their own work. They create sometimes false distinctions between themselves as experts (no one else could possibly do what they do) and lay people, and this continues to keep them out of the mainstream. 10

This sound a lot like the situations accessibility practitioners get into. Being able to run a program requires tapping into power lines to get resources. And it’s easy to become a bottleneck for other people while you’re trying to do accessibility work across an organization, even if that’s not your intent.

So, how do we establish some kind of power to do accessibility work without setting ourselves up as little island kings of accessibility?

The answer is the opposite of the scenario Kanter describes: It’s actively sharing knowledge and establishing trust with colleagues, managers, and leadership, over time and through small, incremental changes, and communicating those changes.

Change management

In DEI Deconstructed, Lily Zheng writes, “when trust is honored and respected, it enables a positive feedback loop of organizational functioning and change.” 11 It’s much easier for people to make change in an organization when they trust their organization and its leadership. Not surprisingly, trust is a critical part of doing accessibility work, which always requires change.

Types of change

There are two main types of change that you might manage in an organization: episodic change and continuous change. 12

Episodic changes are one-offs, or they happen infrequently. They are the changes that get the most attention, usually, even attention outside of the organization. For example, episodic change could be the launch of a product or the creation of a new initiative. Big episodic changes almost always come with support from senior leadership because pulling off a major episodic change requires having buy-in from people who manage the organization’s culture and priorities.

Continuous change, on the other hand, is made up of small changes that happen over time. Continuous improvement is a type of continuous change, for example! Continuous change gets into the nitty gritty of processes, workflows, and practices that actually make changes stick. Continuous change is hard to see for the same reasons it’s so effective: It eventually add up to big impacts, but looking at any one small part of it can make it appear like nothing is happening at all. As a result, it typically doesn’t get the same recognition that episodic change does.

Help people to understand and adapt

The goal of change management is to help people understand and adapt to change in their organization. If an accessibility maturity model is how you measure how effective the change is against a scale, change management is the art and science of managing and communicating about that change. This helps reduce the disruption and discomfort that people always experience with transformation.

Change management might feel like extra work. It also requires vulnerability. It might involve giving people time to grieve the loss of an old process, canceled product, or colleagues who have been laid off. It might require being really, painfully honest with people about why changes are happening (because of a lawsuit or a budget cut, for example). It might require calling out bad behavior. It might include imagining all the worst ways a project could fail and deciding to go ahead with it anyway. 13

Resistance to change

With all this talk of vulnerability and continuous change, don’t be surprised if people are resistant to change. In fact, you should expect it. A lot of people are resistant to accessibility work, so this is a topic we’ll come back to again and again in this book.

Any type of accessibility work comes with the expectation that an organization will change by embracing new ideas and processes. However, even if you do the work for all the right reasons, and especially if you try to play nice with everyone, you will still encounter resistance.

Everyone has different things that trigger resistance or defensiveness, and those things scale up throughout organizational climates and cultures. There are many reasons for resistance to change, but they often fall into one or more of these categories:

Fear. This might be the fear of losing something very tangible, like job security or relationships with colleagues. It also might be less tangible, like fear of the unknown.

Inertia. Moving when you’re already moving is easier. Moving when you’re sitting still is more difficult. Inertia can set in with rigid structures in an organization, or norms in the organizational climate or culture. If it’s extra hard for people to get started with something new, they’re going to avoid doing it.

Threats to power. People might feel threatened if their channels of information, resources, and trust change outside of their control. Accessibility work requires changing a lot about

what we’re doing, which can feel threatening to people who maintain some amount of power from things staying the same.

Prior failures. Even if people want a change to happen, they will be more cautious to fight for change if things didn’t go so well last time (or the time before that, and the time before that).

A lot of change management work is learning about the organization and figuring out who is resisting change and why. The next big step is to identify how to reach those people.

The Rainbow of Death

I first encountered Mike Bland’s Rainbow of Death while doing research on change management in tech. c Evocative name aside, the Rainbow of Death is about reaching people during difficult periods of transition during change management. 14 There are a few main points of this framework that I really took to heart and which I think map perfectly onto accessibility work.

The fractured bell curve

In this model, there are four main groups of stakeholders required for change. These stakeholders are arranged over a bell curve from left to right.

Ĉ. Instigators, a small group who catalyze change or adapt to it early on. D

ĉ. Early Majority, a large group of people who are fine to roll with the change but need support. They’ll expect the Instigators to

provide them with tools, training, and guidance.

Ċ. Late Majority, who prefer to adopt processes and practices that have already been proven to work. They’ll look to the experiences of people in the Early Majority to decide if they want to participate.

ċ. Laggards, a nice word for the small group of people who

actively resist change and challenge the Instigators or Comrades. We’ll talk more about these people in Chapter 9: Communication and coalition.

The bell curve is fractured because it has a huge gap between the Instigators and the Early Majority. This represents the enormous effort needed to bridge across those two groups.

The bridges across the fractures to make the whole

The Rainbow of Death itself represents different ways that Instigators can reach across the chasm to members of the Early Majority. These include activities like teaching them the “right way” to do something, validating their work, mentoring them, and empowering them to understand enough to make their own decisions. In accessibility work, all of these are ways to increase people’s literacy and to gradually grow the organization’s maturity.

I personally like the image of a tiny bridge spanning the chasm between two separate lands because it conveys just how fragile this phase of change is. It also puts the emphasis on establishing relationships and trust with the people who you are helping, which is the core of change management. People are taking a risk by participating, and that needs to be validated and recognized.

We can also extend this same way of thinking to crossing any fracture between groups. The specific techniques you use will be different for each, and the bridges might be of different lengths or constructed of different materials, to extend the metaphor. But you’re designing all of these bridges to connect people at different parts of their journey and usher them along your path.

Chapter summary

This chapter presented different ways of thinking about how organizations function and change.

Maturity is a way to measure how well an organization performs at something. It assumes that an organization that is more mature will practice continuous integration, that is, it will make processes more efficient and effective on a continual basis.

Organizations have two layers of behavior. Climate is how the majority functions and behaves. Culture is the way that organization leadership wants people to function and behave. Understanding the climate and culture of an organization can help you understand why people assume things work in a certain way.

Power flows through organizations along power lines. These are a network of interconnected paths that let supplies, information, and support flow. Understanding the power lines in an organization can help you understand how people make decisions and who gets what resources.

Change management is a framework for helping organizations adapt to change. This depends on the type of change and peoples’ trust level, but it boils down to helping people understand and orient themselves throughout change. One way to understand how to create change is the Rainbow of Death model, which describes making connections between people who create change and people who need to adapt to it.

A. Continuous improvement is closely tied to Lean, which is a methodology for creating transparent, systems-level changes in how people work. Both philosophies came from manufacturing. In software, Lean is often spoken of in relation to Agile, a methodology for doing work in a flexible way. Sometimes people will use all of these terms interchangeably, so I want to acknowledge that they relate to each other but they aren’t the same. [Return to text]

B. The reason I take this literally is that Schein was a sociologist who emigrated from Switzerland to the US in 1938. He is considered the father of organizational theory and was very interested in coercive persuasion (also known as coercive control) by autocratic governments and American businesses alike.

C. The Rainbow of Death was originally written about getting buyin for automated testing at Google in the early 2000s. I find this to be a fascinating example of change management in and of itself, but it’s really hard to think of Google as being an organization that doesn’t automate everything. And yet, there was a time! [Return to text]

D. The word “instigator” can have a negative connotation. After this introduction, I’ll call them Comrades instead throughout the rest of this book. “Comrades” technically has a broader meaning than “instigators,” but it’s more in the spirit of what I’ll be talking about. [Return to text]

Chapter 5: Community

Shell Little: I learned, adapted, and I was in a community, a work community that fostered learning from mistakes, trial and error. It was a very positive learning space. It wasn't judgmental. It wasn't high risk in that regard. It was “Try your best, we don't know what we're doing. We're doing stuff that's beyond WCAG.”

What you’ll read: Accessibility programming creates a community of accessibility practitioners, advocates, champions, and others. This chapter introduces some theories and frameworks around community building.

Communities of practice

Communities of practice are a way to organize around purpose, people, and practice. Communities of practice allow people to share ideas on a particular subject or problem. They do things like establishing mentorship relationships, holding group discussion, telling stories, or other forms of collaboration and learning.

The goal of a community of practice is to help everyone grow their knowledge and skills and apply them to their practice. 1

Figure 11 A three-part diagram showing how people, purpose, and practice are interconnected in communities of practice. This diagram is adapted from one titled “Figure 2.1. Dimensions of practice as properties of community” from the book Communities of Practice. 2

What they are and aren’t

Communities of practice always lack two things:

Ĉ. Hierarchy, where some members are considered “more important” than others

ĉ. Formal leadership, where the same people always run things

People who start and lead communities of practice are often specialists or people with seniority in a community. However, they aren’t people with official power, and they don’t lead people like

organizational leaders do. The way community of practice leaders “lead” is usually by facilitation, not management. They may guide the community’s activities and help them make decisions.

But ultimately, the group is doing things as a collective. Individuals then take what they’ve learned and apply it in their own work or share it with their teams.

If the group develops a hierarchy with formal leadership, that’s not inherently bad! It’s just no longer a community of practice. It’s now probably a working group or a board. Communities of practice can be (but don’t have to be!) the first step before developing a working group, a team, or another more formal response to an issue or need within the organization.

What they do

What communities of practice do best is support communication and collaboration across roles and teams. They are a great way to connect with other people who care about the thing you do. Because they are peer groups, they can support accountability, experimentation, and discovery in more organic ways. These things can be difficult to achieve in a formal hierarchy, where people might be prevented from collaborating with people on other teams.

Communities of practice are also sometimes the best and only way for people across a large organization to identify common gaps or struggles. For example, if a front-end engineer from one team is struggling with a particular problem, they may learn through a community of practice for front-end engineers that others are

dealing with the same thing. This gives them an opportunity to collaborate. That collaboration can potentially lead to creating a best practice that every team can use. This best practice then has the potential to become a component in the organization’s design system, or to contribute to an internal policy.

Communities of practice and knowledge management

Communities of practice are also a chance for people to develop vocabulary and shared language around a topic as a community. It’s natural to create and share documents and other artifacts when you are developing shared language. Sometimes it makes sense for these artifacts to have a formal “home” in the organization’s infrastructure, like in a wiki or directory. The practice of figuring out what should be stored, how it should be organized, and how people in the organization should get access to it is knowledge management. 3

Because communities of practice tend to generate a lot of ideas, discussions, documents, diagrams, and so on, these communities and knowledge management often go hand in hand. 4

Sarah Higley, an accessibility engineer, had this to say about knowledge management when we talked about our work:

The ratio of people who have accessibility expertise to people who work on accessibility is very low. We have a small amount of actual, I would say, accessibility experts to a large amount of people who do some sort of accessibility or who have only learned accessibility at their company.

So essentially what that means is that in terms of talking about the maturity model, I think it is really hard-to-impossible to actually grow institutional knowledge when your ratio is that skewed, unless you have some people who are really good at knowledge management and would be able to help.

If you have a knowledge management team at your organization, first, lucky you, and second, make friends with them. A Third, we’ll talk about knowledge management more in Part 2: Practice. For now, let’s talk about another evaluation tool.

Community readiness

The community readiness model is a tool for helping communities take on initiatives and learn more about themselves. It was originally developed for use in public health education. The goal of using this model is to determine how ready a community is for a particular initiative, then to take actions that will most likely lead to success. 5

The community readiness model has two main parts:

Ĉ. Gathering information from community stakeholders to see how ready they are to address an issue in their community

ĉ. Types of activities that will work best at different readiness levels

Every member is a stakeholder

One of the most important things about this model is that it considers both leaders of a community and “regular” members of the community to be stakeholders. 6 It collects information from both the organizational culture and the climate to give you a clearer picture of what’s actually going on. This is a great way to find and document where the beliefs of leaders and other community members may be different or similar, since they both have an impact on readiness.

Stages of community readiness

The other important thing about this model is that it helps you decide whether your community is ready for an initiative in the first place. The Community Readiness Manual includes 9 different levels, and 5 of them are for stages before an initiative gets an official kickoff. The levels are:

Ĉ. No awareness

ĉ. Denial and/or resistance

Ċ. Vague awareness

ċ. Preplanning

Č. Preparation

č. Initiation

Ď. Stabilization

ď. Confirmation and/or expansion

Đ. High level of community ownership 7

Often, models that measure where a community or organization is on an issue start with the beginning of the program and measure from there. This model accounts for the critical “pre-work” part of building a program or initiative. It’s refreshingly realistic in that it starts with the question, “Is this community even ready to deal with this issue?” and accepts that the answer might be, “No.”

Drawing some parallels

If you read through this section thinking, “This sounds very familiar,” that’s because it is. You learned about similar models in the previous chapters. To bring them together:

A maturity model is a tool for measuring an organization’s operations. It answers: How well is the organization operating in a particular area?

A literacy model or framework is a tool for measuring an individual’s knowledge and understanding. It answers: How developed is this person’s understand this particular topic?

A community readiness model is a tool for measuring a community’s sentiment. It answers: How does a community feel about a particular topic, and what can we do about it?

Each of these tools captures information about what people are thinking and doing around a topic within an organization. Together, they can help you capture what’s really going on, which will be enormously helpful in the next part of this book.

Mutual aid

Mutual aid is a framework that people in a community can use to organize with each other around an issue or to share resources. Mutual aid has three main principles:

Ĉ. Meet people where they are to understand and meet their needs.

ĉ. Create solidarity between people with different ideas and beliefs.

Ċ. Solve problems through collective action.

8

What, you might be wondering, does this have to do with accessibility operations? Here’s what: In Chapter 2: Education and literacy, I said that a great deal of education and literacy work is about meeting people where they are. Mutual aid builds on this idea too. And sure, accessibility work requires reaching out to people with different ideas and beliefs and working together to solve problems. But the similarities run deeper than that, in a way that connects this chapter to the next.

Without getting too far ahead of myself, mutual aid is relevant to accessibility work—especially accessibility operations workbecause mutual aid happens in the cracks of a system. It actually happens because there are cracks in a system in the first place. Mutual aid focuses on building relationships and creating solidarity to reduce harm and provide support to people who get stuck in those cracks.

Accessibility work starts within the cracks of other systems in the same way. On its face, accessibility work is about patching up the huge gaps in processes, tools, and responsibility that perpetuate accessibility issues in organizations. It’s about working against the odds to make systems work in ways they don’t seem to be designed to support. This is a topic we’ll explore more throughout this book.

Solidarity and affinity

The concept of “solidarity” is the source of a lot of jokes about leftist in-fighting. One of the challenges and benefits of a diverse coalition of people working together is that you’re going to get different opinions. Another word you can generally use in place of “solidarity” is affinity. I really like this description of affinity from a book called Joyful Militancy:

Affinity is a helpful concept for us because it speaks to emergent relationships and forms of organizing that are decentralized and flexible but not flimsy. Organizing by affinity basically means seeking out and nurturing relationships based in shared values, commitments and passions, without trying to impose those on everyone else. 9

As a concept, affinity gives you permission to work with people that you don’t agree with 100%. You will often encounter people who don’t share all of your politics or opinions, but who you can nonetheless work with them fruitfully. It also means you can perform an action that you believe in without “imposing” why you believe in it on others. This can be a way to sneakily start getting people doing

accessibility work even before they know what that means, which we’ll talk about more in later chapters.

Anti-charity

Mutual aid and methodologies like it are largely built in response to the charity model. If you’ve ever worked in charities, non-profits, or government, you’ll know that responses to peoples’ needs often come with a lot of strings attached. 10

Ultimately, organizations need to answer to stakeholders (citizens, donors, shareholders, etc.), so they set up rules around what they can and can’t do. Mutual aid, on the other hand, seeks to cut through the strings and address very specific needs, right now. It often operates outside of traditional power structures, and means that even people who don’t have formal power can participate and help.

Local

Now, you might be thinking, this seems like it would be hard to sustain at scale, and it is! Mutual aid groups usually work very locally by design. Each one is ultimately dedicated to a small area or localized effort, but they can also network and help each other.

And even if it’s local, mutual aid can be highly visible and impactful. An example of this would be when members of the Black Panther Party, and other activist groups, provided critical support for the Section 504 protesters in San Francisco in 1977. 11 While disability activists held down a federal building for 26 days, they relied on other groups like the Black Panthers to get them food, medication,

and other necessities. Those actions were local, but the effects were national, if not global.

Mutual aid demonstrates that advocacy work is part of a larger project, which requires finding allies across different communities with different goals, which we’ll talk more about in the next chapter.

Non-hierarchical and non-judgmental

Mutual aid is meant to be scrappy, practical, organized by people, and non-judgmental. Not non-profits, not government agencies, just normal everyday people, which is crucial to how mutual aid operates.

For example, organizing with your community to provide food, toiletries, fuel, and clothing to unhoused neighbors once a week is a form of mutual aid. Forming a non-profit to get government funding to do the same thing is not mutual aid.

Like communities of practice, mutual aid relies on decision-making that is transparent and based on consensus. The members of the group don’t have to agree on everything. In fact, they don’t have to agree on anything except what the group is doing and how the group is doing it! The people that mutual aid helps don’t have to have aligned politics, beliefs, or opinions either, and people are not denied aid because of their politics, beliefs, or opinions.

No saviors

Lastly, mutual aid operates with the rule that there are no saviors in a sustainable movement. 12 People shouldn’t be judged for how much or how little they can help. This is a group effort for the long haul, working against a systemic issue, which requires everyone to pace themselves. If everyone is a candle burning at both ends, that defeats the purpose of doing the work at all. Instead, being able to participate in the ways that work best for you should be celebrated. It’s no accident that mutual aid groups can be full of disabled people and people with other marginalized identities who might have a hard time participating in other types of helping.

My goal with this book is to help you find ways to do accessibility work that don’t burn you out. For this work to be sustainable, we need to create systems that allow many people to do a little bit over a long time, rather than a few people doing too much for too little time. I think the principles and aims of mutual aid are a great template to start to strategize for the long game.

Chapter summary

This chapter introduced theories about community.

Communities of practice are groups that form around a shared interest. They are a way to exchange information and resources, with a focus on everyone taking part in learning. They can be a vehicle for organizational change.

Community readiness is a framework that can help you decide what you should tackle next to help a community learn and grow. It helps you collect information on how people in the community feel about an issue or topic. It considers that there is a lot of groundwork that needs to happen before communities are ready to undertake a big initiative or change.

Mutual aid is an anti-charity model for helping each other and our communities. The goal of mutual aid is to help a community with an urgent need that isn’t being met by formal structures. Like communities of practice, mutual aid does not have a hierarchy. It puts an emphasis on joining forces for a common goal without requiring that everyone has all of the same goals.

Chapter 6: Intersectionality and disability

Alexis Lucio: To me, the easiest part of accessibility is the technical part. The hardest part is doing your own inner work to make sure that you're not harming the exact people that your profession aims to serve, or those working in the field alongside you. And this is where people get upset at me for speaking up (on colonialism, racism, eugenics, etc.). I’m upset that that's the thing people are upset about. [laughs]

What you’ll read: In this chapter, you’ll learn about intersectionality and how disability intersects with other identities. You’ll also learn about ableism and how it intersects with other forms of oppression.

This chapter has a content warning for discussions of ableism and White supremacy.

Society’s impact on the workplace

To begin this topic, I think it’s important to revisit how organizations work. In Chapter 4: Organizations, I talked about how organizations have cultures. Organizations also function from within a larger culture, which has an enormous impact.

The culture, values, and morals of a society are always going to influence an organization inside it. These influences are going to impact the lived experiences of its people. Rituals in organizations, such as meetings and performance reviews, reinforce the culture of the organization, as well.

The same goes for professions like the accessibility field. Events for professions, like conferences, and expectations like certain degrees, certifications, or work experience are all touched by the larger culture. A

Since this book is about doing accessibility work through an antiableist lens, we must talk about disability and ableism in our culture. And, since disability doesn’t exist in a vacuum, it’s a good opportunity to talk about other vectors of marginalization and oppression, since those impact our work too. I have included many resources about intersectionality for this chapter at the end of the book. I hope that you will find them useful.

Models of disability

One thing to always consider when we talk about models of disability is that each model represents a time, place, and agenda. That agenda might be one you agree with, or it might be one you don’t agree with. Regardless, these models were useful to someone at some point, and they may be useful to you in your work. Honestly, how you even define “disability” will depend on who you are trying to educate and how.

If you are familiar with this topic, you’re likely familiar with the two big models that often come up in these discussions: the medical model, and the social model. 1 I think of these as representing different ends of a spectrum of models. Here are some very broad descriptions of this spectrum.

The medical model of disability focuses on the medical-ness and body-ness of disability. It often frames disability as something to be fixed or healed, but not always. It often focuses on the individual by way of their needs or limits.

The social model came about in reaction to the medical model. The social model of disability says that barriers faced by disabled people as a community and as individuals are created by social systems and spaces. This is because these social systems and spaces were made by non-disabled people, without disabled people in mind. Usually this gets extrapolated to mean that disability is “created” in society and not in the individual.

I’ve come to find usefulness in both models. I usually teach the social model as an entry point. It’s often pretty radical to people who are new to accessibility and disability theory. It also aligns well with people’s day-to-day work, which usually revolves around providing products or services to people, which may create barriers, knowingly or unknowingly.

However, I usually find myself mixing the two to some degree when I get into the topic in more depth. This is where the biopsychosocial model comes into play. This model comes from psychology, and I think it’s a great fit for what we do. 2 This model

reflects both the reality of being othered by social spaces and systems, as well as disability existing as a reality in your physical body and mind. I find I align best with this model for myself these days.

In “My Body Doesn’t Oppress Me, Society Does,” Stacey Milbern summarizes holding both of these models at once, where yes, society causes issues, but disability is also a very physical reality.

I really like separating out impairment from disability. So impairment as like physical or neurological manifestationlike what’s real. I have a physical impairment. And then disability is like what society creates as barriers because of the impairment. 3

For example, sometimes people take the social model so far as to say that without modern society and without capitalism, there wouldn’t be disabilities. Even as a person with largely invisible disabilities, I know that’s not the case for me. Even without capitalism, I would still have chemical imbalances and chronic pain. Getting rid of society as we know it doesn’t get rid of some things that trigger my fibromyalgia flares, like weather or a poor night’s sleep.

Here are some other common models of disability you might encounter as you explore this topic more 4 :

The charity model, which tends to be paternalistic

The functional model, which focuses on individual technical solutions

The market or economic model, which focuses on disabled people as an untapped economic market to sell products and services to

The minority model, which positions disability as a minority experience, the same way people have minority experiences based on gender, race, sexual orientation, and so on

Depending on who you’re talking to, you will probably find yourself mixing and matching ideas from different models. Even if you don’t reference them explicitly, they can help you frame disability in different ways for different people to understand.

Intersectionality

Intersectionality (a term coined by Dr. Kimberlé Crenshaw) 5 means that “different dimensions of identity, difference, and inequity (e.g., race, class, gender, ability, sexual orientation, etc.) are considered concurrently.” 6

That is, everyone has multiple dimensions to them. To engage with oppression effectively, we must consider how an individual's interpersonal, institutional, and societal identities impact how they move through the world.

For example, we know from research that women (especially Black women) are more likely to be misdiagnosed when seeking medical care as compared to White men. 7 Black children are more likely than children of other races to be misdiagnosed, underdiagnosed, or overdiagnosed by medical professionals. 8 Black children are also

more likely to struggle with standardized tests. 9 All of this disproportionately affects disabled Black children, whose disabilities are more likely to be criminalized. 10

The experience of a Black, queer, disabled, trans person is going to be different than that of a White, straight, disabled cis man, even if they share the same disability, socioeconomic class, resident status, geographic region, and language.

I could go on, but I think you probably get the idea.

Since ability/disability is a facet of identity, we cannot fully understand or address the disabled experience without also considering how that experience intersects with others. As a result, taking intersectionality into account is crucial to meeting the needs of all disabled people.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion

Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI, and all its variants) is about issues of identity and exclusion in workplaces. Accessibility is part of equity, since its goal is to provide equitable access to places, products, and services for disabled people.

Unless you’ve studied or worked in the DEI field, your introduction to DEI was probably in a workplace. There are many parallels between how DEI has happened (and not happened) in organizations with how accessibility has happened (and not happened) in organizations. I think the accessibility field suffers from some of the same missteps, which I’ll talk about more throughout this book.

The biggest similarity is that organizations typically address DEI only under duress. While DEI has existed in some form or another for decades in the United States, it became part of mainstream culture after cops murdered George Floyd in 2020. 11 His murder, among others, led Black workers to express their grief and outrage at how organizations were doing business as usual.

In response, many organizations launched or put renewed emphasis on DEI programs. This is an oversimplification, but the point is that a lot of White people didn’t hear about DEI until after the first summer of Black Lives Matter.

Similarly, many organizations don’t address accessibility until they are facing a lawsuit or other legal barrier. Leadership is either not aware of it or thinks it’s an acceptable risk. Workers often weren’t trained to do accessibility work and it’s not accommodated in their existing processes and workflows. However, now they must figure out what doing accessibility work entails, and do it by a deadline.

Not surprisingly, DEI and accessibility are both fields where practitioners often burn out from overwork and lack of resources. Both are areas that are usually the first to go in layoffs and budget cuts. 12 Both are considered “nice to have.” Both also work best when people work in coalition, instead of for individual groups’ rights.

All of this is to say that the accessibility field can learn from the successes and failures of the DEI field. In DEI Deconstructed, Lily Zheng writes about two of the biggest failures in the field, which are the lack of measurable success and a tendency to address

symptoms of inequality and not the root cause. My hope is that this book will give you ideas to do both of those things.

Ableism

Ableism is the belief that non-disabled people are worth more than disabled people. This belief leads to the idea that disabled people don’t take part in society as much as non-disabled people do. This belief causes assumptions like:

Disabled people don’t use technology or the Internet

Disabled people don’t have jobs

Disabled people don’t make or enjoy art

Disabled people don’t have hobbies, play sports, or travel

Disabled people don’t have sex or romantic relationships

Disabled people don’t have children

Disabled people don’t lead fulfilling lives

Ableism also assumes that disability is a monolith and that disabled people can speak on behalf of everyone that has their disability, or all disabled people.

Ableism is common in workplaces. 13 The assumption is that workers are non-disabled. They are especially not assumed to be disabled and Black, or disabled and Black and Indigenous, and so on. One identity per person for simplicity’s sake, please!

For example, many accommodations that made work more accessible during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic aren’t available anymore. If a person does request accommodations, their request is usually treated as a one-off, never as part of a systemic issue of ableism within the organization. This makes it much easier for organizations to decline to provide accommodations for individuals, or to make getting accommodations so difficult that people will give up. It means the organization doesn’t have to invest its time, effort, or money into identifying systemic barriers to disabled people.

If people do get accommodations, it’s often viewed as a great success and can quickly turn into inspiration porn. “Susie had to out herself as being autistic to the whole leadership team but got the okay to wear headphones at her desk in our open floor plan office because we got rid of working from home, we’re learning so much every day! #inclusion #diversity #disAbilities”

In accessibility work, ableism usually takes two forms. One is the assumption that disabled people don’t use the products and services we make. The other is the assumption that there aren’t already disabled people in our organizations. These intersect frequently.

Non-disabled people will say baffling things like, “Disabled people don’t use our product!” They are comfortable saying this at work because they believe that none of their customers are disabled, and neither are any of their coworkers. They assume that everyone else believes this, too, since they believe it.

This is exhausting for disabled accessibility practitioners, because being a living, breathing teachable moment is exhausting. This is even shittier for people who work along other axes of oppression at the same time and/or who can’t mask their disability at work.

For example, maybe you were coming to like and trust a coworker and were considering outing yourself as disabled to them. Then they make an ableist joke. They’ve now put up a new, invisible boundary you need to cross if you ever want this person to be a colleague in anti-ableist work. Maybe that person is your manager. Maybe they’re your director. Maybe they’re your CEO. Depending on who the person is and what type of power they have in the organization, that boundary might have a huge impact on the climate you are working in or the culture you are working against.

Ableism and White supremacy

White supremacy is the belief that people who are White are superior to others. 14 It’s also the belief that all people exist in a strict hierarchy, so people who are straight, neurotypical, and nondisabled are also superior to those who are queer, neurodivergent, and disabled. It’s an umbrella of hate. It also follows that “White culture” is superior to other cultures, to the point that it’s deemed perfectly acceptable and desirable to destroy other cultures through any means necessary. 15

Here are some examples of White supremacy values that negatively impact disabled people as well as everyone else, of course. 16

Perfectionism: “I can’t do it right the first time, so I won’t try.”

Individualism: “I need to overcome my disability because I’m a burden to my friends and family.”

Sense of urgency: “We don’t have time to make this product accessible. That takes a lot of work, and this is only an MVP. We’ll do it later.”

Defensiveness: “Well, I’m not ableist. I just think disabled people shouldn’t get special treatment.”

Paternalism: “Our clients aren’t disabled, they’re speciallyabled!”

Fear: “You’re such an inspiration. I wouldn’t want to keep living if I were disabled like you!”

Our organizations are built within an ableist and White supremacist society. Ableism is just one face of White supremacy. When people in power put systems in place to protect the status quo, ableism is part of that status quo. Ableism is so insidious that even if people aren’t making accessibility barriers on purpose, it’s still much easier, and much more rewarded, to create barriers, rather than to destroy them.

Accessibility work must be informed by intersectionalism. This is work against multiple intersecting systems of oppression. It is impossible to address ableism or to be anti-ableist without also working against White supremacy.

Disability justice

Disability justice is a movement that seeks to address the root cause of ableism through coalition. The term was coined by members of Sins Invalid, a collective of disabled artists led by disabled artists of color. In Skin, Tooth, and Bone: The Basis of Movement is Our People, A Disability Justice Primer, Sins Invalid write that:

Rights-based strategies often address the symptoms in inequity but not the root. The root of disability oppression is ableism and we must work to understand it, combat it, and create alternative practices rooted in justice. 17

Sins Invalid also point to principles of disability justice that sound a great deal like the principles of mutual aid and other practices I’ve shared. This includes intersectionality, cross-movement solidarity, sustainability, and interdependence. 18

In “What’s Next?: Teaching and Learning Disability Justice with Lydia X.Z. Brown and Anna Landre,” Brown takes this further. They explicitly connect disability justice to the broader project of antiWhite supremacy and anti-capitalism:

[Trying] to simply change the social condition for disabled people by changing our laws and our policies locally or nationally is not going to get us to the end goal of liberation. That’s what disability justice seeks, liberation from ableism, from White supremacy, from capitalism, from every other system of exploitation, deprivation, marginalization, and oppression. 19

Studying the disability rights movement is essential for anti-ableist work, to understand our history. However, it’s equally necessary to consider more systemic ideas like disability justice. To that end, the rest of this book is really about systems, both creating them and fighting against them. To do that, it’s critical to think and work in systems, which we’ll explore in Part 2: Practice.

How do I use this?

At this point you might be thinking, “This chapter is all well and good, but how can I possibly apply it in a corporate setting without getting fired? How the fuck am I supposed to talk to my coworkers about White supremacy and disability justice when I can’t even get them to pay attention long enough to stop calling alt text ‘alt tags?’”

The answer is you can’t. Well, you can, just not in so many words. Let me explain.

Progress around disability and accessibility doesn’t happen in weeks, or even months. It happens in years and decades. That’s hard to swallow when so many of us are getting chewed up and spat out by another corporation every 1–2 years or are excluded from work because of our disabilities. That feels unconscionable when so many people are displaced from their homes because of war and climate change. That feels impossible when you are trying to stay alive and healthy in 2024.

But this is a long game we’re playing. It requires us to regard the bigger picture, especially when we’re feeling so discouraged to even

consider a bigger picture.

Intentions matter

Ableism is a system. Often when we look at systems that have negative impacts, we get stuck on the intentions of the people who designed it. They didn’t mean for all of those negative impacts to happen, surely! They happened because systems are complex, right? It just kind of got away from us, right? Well, yes and no. Yes, systems can do things we don’t expect when we don’t fully understand them. But systems are also extremely good at doing what they are designed to do.

POSIWID, an acronym coined by systems theorist Stafford Beer, stands for “The Purpose of a System Is What It Does.” 20 POSIWID says that systems work exactly as we intend them to. In fact, systems are exactly as flawed and biased as people are, because they are made by people.

Here’s a society-level example. In the United States, the prison system puts much more emphasis on punishment than it does on rehabilitation. People who want to deflect criticism of the prison industrial complex often say that the problem isn’t the system, it’s “bad apples” who abuse the system, or criminals who just can’t help but reoffend because they’re criminals. But using POSIWID, we can show that the prison industrial complex is designed to punish, not to rehabilitate.

We can understand this easily based on the way that government officials allocate resources for prisons compared to other services,

and how they allow prisons to be for profit in some states. 21 We can also observe how authorities treat people that go to prison, and how little to no systemic support is given to people that make their way out of prison. To help this cycle, a great number of social systems, such as public schools in majority non-White communities, are extremely good at putting people, especially people who live along multiple axes of oppression, into prison in the first place. 22 With this context, it’s almost shocking when this system doesn’t work.

Here's another example that brings things closer to the accessibility field. You have almost certainly had to participate in systems that are less than ideal at work. For example, you might have to use your organization’s learning management system (LMS) for your training materials. Those systems often measure one thing: Did this person complete a course or not. They might also measure how well a person completed a multiple-choice quiz at the end of a lesson or course.

However, neither of those metrics can tell you if a person actually learned anything from the course. The metrics also can’t tell you if the person is applying what they learned to their work. Therefore, if those are the metrics that are available, it’s safe to say that an LMS is designed to measure compliance and completion, not integrating concepts into day-to-day work.

So, if ableism is a system, it follows that we need an opposing system, anti-ableism, to counter it.

Ableism and anti-ableism are choices

The systems that inform our workplaces—the systems that make our workplaces and products ableist by default—were put in place for a reason. That reason is that they benefited, and continue to benefit, the status quo, as they were designed to. So if we are trying to undo those systems, we must envision the world we actually want. Our desire for a world without ableism has to be at the center of our imagining, planning, and doing.

If the program you build isn’t aiming to be anti-ableist, it won’t be. If it’s not trying to be intersectional, it won’t be. If it’s not seeking disability justice, it won’t be liberating for disabled people. Our intentions in designing a system can’t be more important. Our choices in who we work with and where we get our information are as important as what we end up creating together.

Sarah Higley put this into perspective when she told me about her thoughts on how disability justice fits into technical work:

Pay attention to the source of your institutional knowledge [about accessibility]. Where is your information coming from? What are you teaching new people? Who’s making decisions and where are they getting their information from?

You need people who understand both disability and accessibility within the technology platform you’re building on. Sometimes they can be the same person, but they don’t have to be. You can’t only have people who understand disability and who are disabled. And you can’t only have people who understand “accessibility,” or the platform technology. You

need disability justice and understanding of disability and understanding accessibility in the context of the technology.

And you need enough people who have knowledge in both of those areas to inform decisions and testing and learning for new people. If you don’t have that, you’re creating technical debt, knowledge debt for your organization. And it just becomes harder and harder as you go down the line sorting out the good information from the bad because you accumulate bad information. Because people need to make decisions somehow. And if the inputs for those decisions that are being made—because they’ll be made no matter what—are bad, then you’re going to have to untangle that later. It snowballs and it’s so much harder later to try to fix that.

During their interview, EJ Mason put it this way:

One of the things that I try to do in my advocacy, when it comes to technical stuff and the complex social things that are behind those technical choices, is to acknowledge that you have to choose anti-ableism on purpose over and over and over again. You don't get to do a good thing and have that be a resting position where you are now a good person. Good is not a thing. It is not a trait. It's a behavior. It's a behavior that you do over and over again as often as you can. Disabled people have to learn how to choose anti-ableism, too—having a common identity alone is not enough to make someone want to free you. I want to work with people, disabled or non-

disabled, who want to free me and who want to work together to free everybody.

Chapter summary

This chapter introduced theories about intersectionality, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and how disability and accessibility fit into those.

There are different models of disability. Depending on which model people have in mind, they will think about disability differently in different contexts. You may need to use different models to teach people about disability.

Intersectionality is the idea that people have multiple identities or facets of identity. They can experience oppression or privilege in multiple ways. It’s important to understand how we each are harmed by or benefit from these different facets.

Organizations sometimes have teams or initiatives dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Disability and accessibility are part of this work.

Ableism is a system of oppression that says non-disabled people are more important than disabled people. Fighting ableism needs to be a core part of accessibility work to address this.

White supremacy is a larger system of oppression that includes many types of oppression. It includes systems like ableism, racism, classism, queerphobia, transphobia, and others. White supremacy is the default for our society.

Disability justice is a movement that comes after the disability rights movement. Disability rights was and is focused on disabled people being able to have privilege and safety in an ableist society. Disability justice is focused on eliminating ableism, which is the root cause of the need to fight for privilege or safety for disabled people. To do sustainable work in the accessibility field, we need to constantly make choices to be anti-ableist.

Part 2: Practice

A change in purpose changes a system profoundly, even if every element and interconnection remains the same.

Chapter 7: Accessibility operations

Sarah Higley: Accessibility is human experience. That doesn't scale. It scales in impact, but there isn’t a scaled solution to making everything accessible. On a fundamental level, the understanding you have to build and the amount of time you have to just spend listening to people—that doesn't scale in the same way that creating good UX doesn't scale. If you want to do it right, it doesn't scale.

What you’ll read: In this chapter, you’ll learn about the accessibility operations model and how it ties into anti-ableist work. You’ll learn its benefits and drawbacks, and how it compares to traditional program management and ad hoc accessibility efforts.

As a discipline and as a profession, the digital accessibility field is still very new. I don’t mean that accessibility is a new need, or that the decades of advocacy people have been doing in this area don’t count. What I mean is that we are still fighting for a seat at the table instead of being simply allowed to do our work.

Organizations are bad at hiring, supporting, and placing accessibility practitioners. People don’t know what to do with us, how to work with us, or how to listen to us. We get placed to run programs and initiatives without proper skills or experience. We are

left out of critical conversations. We end up working reactively. Even when we do get to work proactively, it’s usually in ways that can’t scale sustainably.

Before we get into the operations model, I want to dig into these issues more, and specifically call out how they result in the effects we discussed in Chapter 1: Burnout.

Bearers of bad news

Often, accessibility practitioners are made to be compliance police rather than allowed to be facilitators of anti-ableism. We are often the messenger, and the message is usually bad news. We’re brought in at the last minute, to run an audit or help teams fix high priority issues in work that’s already complete. We are expected to do this even if we don’t have the organization’s support to make lasting change. We usually don’t have any authority to prevent teams from shipping things we already know are broken.

This is overwhelming, unproductive, and discouraging for us as the practitioners and the teams we are trying to help.

Trying to scale through replication

When a product team is “successful” at accessibility work, management and leadership often want to replicate that success. The type of “success” I’m talking about is typically what results from having one or more accessibility subject matter specialists embed with a team for a specific period of time.

To explore this, let’s consider two scenarios:

Ĉ. A product team has a permanently embedded accessibility specialist

ĉ. A product team has a temporarily embedded accessibility specialist, who rotates between teams in the organization.

Having a permanent accessibility specialist is like winning the lottery for a product team. Ideally, it supports teaching teams about accessibility through what they’re actively working on every day, which is a good way to reinforce learning in adults.

Unfortunately, what teams often take away from having an embedded accessibility specialist is that it is that the specialist’s job to do accessibility work for the team. If the specialist’s job is accessibility, the other team members don’t have to worry about it, right? The specialist will always be on the hook, because that’s there job.

And, since organizations struggle so much to hire and keep accessibility practitioners, only some teams get an embedded specialist. Specialists who are embedded will get informal and formal requests from other teams for support, too. They end up doing accessibility work for multiple teams, which is just more work, not the work scaled across teams.

Now what happens if embedding is temporary and specialists hop from team to team? If specialists rotate through teams, they function as visiting experts. Teams are incentivized to extract as much information and attention from them as possible. This is

exhausting to facilitate, especially when you are embedding with teams with no breaks in between.

Also, someone has to prioritize which teams get a specialist first. Who decides that? How? Do specialists end up on teams that already get the most resources because they work on high priority projects? What does this say about how the teams are valued? What happens when everyone from the team with the highest priority gets laid off, or moved to another team, or quits? Where does that knowledge go? Do “visiting” specialists just start the process all over again?

Mary Elizabeth Sullivan described some positives and negatives about this type of model when we chatted.

There was all this conflict [around accessibility], but the fundamental pieces of sign-offs and the buy-in conversations allowed for things to move forward in a positive way. They created wins that we could then point to when we were having discussions with other teams.

It created a system of positive reinforcement. Then when people tried to use business tactics of, “Oh, well, this other team isn’t doing it,” we started having better ways of approaching that to say, “Well, one, your team has been chosen to work with us. Second, here’s some people [on other teams we’ve worked with who] you can learn from if you want to talk to them and understand their perspectives.”

It created more of a cohesive organization of support because everyone was doing accessibility work at the bottom. Those directors had less ability to negate what we were doing as accessibility professionals because it wasn’t just an accessibility person saying it. It was the accessibility person and the development team lead and the other development team lead saying, “Oh no, this is what’s actually happening.”

Now, could I reproduce it? Probably not. I’ve learned that if you don’t have the right leader that can integrate into the politics however they need to, you’re just not going to have the same sort of support.

On one hand, moving between teams in a formal way like this can create the type of cohesive climate Mary Elizabeth speaks to. It’s one way to get a lot of people who have impact on an organization’s climate to buy in. But what if something higher priority comes up? If a leader isn’t invested? This model, and an organization’s accessibility practitioners, can crash and burn long before a team ships their product.

Everyone is responsible, so no one is, so I am

One of the other recurring themes of accessibility work is how it doesn’t fit anywhere. I’d also argue that this is the core reason that we tend to flit from team to team. Accessibility work doesn’t fit into the traditional concept of a project because it can’t be its own finite project, but it also can’t be divorced from literally every other

project. It’s an every project problem, which is why it’s usual bumped up to being a program.

But accessibility doesn’t fit into traditional program management either, because it can’t “live” in a single part of an organization. It’s not a product problem, or a legal problem, or a human resources problem, or a knowledge management problem. It’s an every discipline, every division, and every organization problem. When they’re situated in one part of an organization alone, specialists often find that there are barriers across parts of the organization that keep them from doing their job.

Accessibility doesn’t fit in a traditional individual contributor role like design, development, or content, or a program manager role, or a legal role, and so on. And the result of all these problems is that they are a recipe for burnout. If no part of the work fits neatly inside the fences we use to corral people and processes in organizations, there are no clear expectations or boundaries for accessibility practitioners. Our professional identities can’t be contained. There is nothing we can point to, no measurement, no “normal” that is actually normal, to say, “Hey, you’re asking me to do too much, we need to reign it back to ‘here’.” I would argue that even if there were a “normal” in this space, many of us would struggle to maintain it.

To do this work and do it effectively without harming ourselves, we need as much space and time as possible to allow the communities that we are fostering to grow and live and breathe. We need to stay connected to others so that we don’t forget we are human beings

(animals!) who flourish when we can rest and make art and hang out with our pets and cook with our friends.

I’d like for us to think about alternatives in to the traditional models I’ve described. And one alternative I’ve found success with is the operations model.

DevOps

The operations model is probably best known through DevOps. If you’re not familiar, DevOps comes from the words “development” and “operations.” Usually, DevOps teams include information technologists (IT specialists) and engineers. DevOps teams manage tools, workflows, and processes for making software, deploying it, and maintaining it, often for a whole organization. Since DevOps teams are often small and inside large organizations, they often work on problems around automating and scaling tools and resources.

At first glance, this might seem like an excuse to have fewer workers and more automated tools. Which, sure, is probably a good selling point to leadership? A But the reason that DevOps emphasizes automation so heavily is that the other focus of DevOps work is building relationships and community.

The term [DevOps] covers culture changes, such as building trust and cohesion between developers and systems administrators and aligning technological projects to business requirements. 1

In short, DevOps is about tooling and automation but it is also about building and maintaining relationships and leveraging organization values. That sounds familiar, doesn’t it?

Applying operations to accessibility

A lot of us have already being doing accessibility operations by accident since we get little investment from our organizations. We just haven’t been oriented to think that way, and the blame for that doesn’t fall on us. Most accessibility roles are 3– 5 roles poorly concealed in a trench coat. Accessibility already requires knowledge of a wide variety of skills, tools, processes, and systems.

The obvious capitalistic solution is to find one person to do all of these things. However, the obvious functional solution is to operationalize. It’s to have multiple people taking on different facets of the work, with a focus on growing a community of many people with varied backgrounds and needs to carry the load.

Here are some things that you’re possibly already doing that are part of accessibility operations.

Collaborating and strategizing with others. This requires

identifying people’s roles, interests, and strengths, as well as learning about how power and resources move through an organization. It requires fostering community. It requires figuring out who you can trust and who you can’t, and why.

Running experiments and pilots. This might feel messy, but you are doing social science! Each experiment is a test to see what

works and what doesn’t. All of this is information for you to integrate next time, even if it’s felt like failure. It’s not failure.

Showing up regularly. Monthly meetings, quarterly reports, weekly office hours—all of these things are examples of operationalizing how you spend your time and how you offer yourself to your community. If people know when and how to expect to seek you out, they will bother you less when you need time to decompress or focus.

Leveraging knowledge management. Resources like wikis,

handbooks, and repositories of research are all ways to preserve information when an organization is in churn. Spending time improving and maintaining these resources fits into operations because it’s giving people options for directing their own learning and growth.

Doing slow and steady work. Organizations and other systems are

like organisms. They require resources to run, and if they grow too big too fast, they will fail, or die. Working slowly, iteratively, and proactively instead of quickly, desperately, and reactively will make your practice healthier.

A formal introduction to accessibility operations

As of July 2024, when I was revising this chapter, searching online showed that some large organizations already have accessibility operations teams or directors. Accessibility operations can also

have other names, too. For example, when I was officially doing accessibility operations it was as part of a team called Research Operations and Enablement.

The phrase “accessibility operations” is actually used in the June 2024 draft of the W3C’s Accessibility Maturity Model, although confusingly it’s only used in the description of the Knowledge and Skills dimension. 2 All of this is to say I did not come up with the term, and I was certainly not the first person to try to apply this model to managing accessibility in an organization. However, I haven’t seen a clear definition for accessibility operations before, so here we go.

Accessibility operations is the philosophy and practice of connecting people, technology, and processes to create, maintain, and improve accessibility for products and services.

Like DevOps before it, accessibility ops is focused on automating and systematizing (aka organizing) as much as possible, to leave us time, space, and energy to do the really hard work. The core of our work is building, managing, and maintaining relationships between people in service of creating a more accessible and equitable world by centering disabled people, anti-ableism, and intersectional equity.

Operations can also help normalize accessibility work as being continuous. C It’s not a project, or a program, or a series of checkpoints with a finite end. It’s something that’s always there, and always needs to be considered, like security, localization, and other types of inclusivity. It also doesn’t negate the opportunity for teams

to work closely with specialists, or to have an in-house accessibility practitioner, if that works in your organization. You can have that, and still have an accessibility ops team.

Pillars of anti-ableism in accessibility operations

Accessibility efforts have historically started with fixing issues or training individual contributors (ICs) about designing and building accessible products, to deal with risk. To use a gardening metaphor, this approach depends on planting seeds in soil that hasn’t been properly prepared. If the soil hasn’t been tilled, loosened, and watered, it’s no wonder the seeds don’t take root. This reactionary approach ignores how power and ideas flow through organizations. And this approach can be actively harmful for disabled users and disabled workers because it makes people resentful and stressed out about accessibility work, instead of excited and hopeful.

One of the practitioners I spoke with put it this way:

We’re fighting against ableism, really. You have so many people who are just so afraid about disability and think it’s this hugely negative thing. They think their life will be over if they even acknowledge disability being a thing. They would have to face their own mortality, let’s be completely honest. They do so much to not to think about it. Anything that could potentially make them think about that, they will really fight against. Disability, just what it is, it’s too much.

And then we’re coming in and being like, “Hey, disability is not the end of your life. Hey, can you put alt text on this image?”

That is too much for a lot of people.

To help address this, there are three pillars I recommend building your operations work around. When in doubt, cling to these, and they will help you center your work. They are:

Ĉ. Equity and coalition

ĉ. Processes and workflows

Ċ. Literacy

I want to be very clear that anti-ableism is more complex than the three pillars I’m introducing here, and each pillar has many moving parts. But I think these are a good starting place in our context. Here’s why.

Equity and coalition

Prioritize programming that builds equity and creates coalition across the organization. You might be surprised by how much you can do with a strong grassroots coalition, even without senior leadership buy-in. This comes back to creating change in the organizational climate, which can ultimately push up against the culture. Grow the grassroots, strengthen bonds, and focus on doing work that makes improvements across the board for marginalized communities. Leverage your organization’s stated values and/or mission to do this.

If the work is very new or the organization is very immature in its accessibility journey, prioritize programming that builds

equity and creates coalition across the organization. This is putting affinity, or solidarity, into action. c

Processes and workflows

Addressing processes and workflows often includes experimenting with things like testing tools, instruction methods, and vendors. Improving processes and workflows with tools, resources, and training creates improvements for everyday work. You can adapt accessibility principles and frameworks to your audiences by creating best practices, policies, and processes that fit your colleagues’ current needs.

You can get a lot of mileage out of establishing the best way to do something, even if people don’t understand all the nuances yet. Focus on decreasing the friction for teams to do accessibility basics and focus on the things that will have the biggest impact on customers and employees.

Literacy

You’ve already read quite a bit on this topic from me, so I will only say here that establishing literacy in others is the best way to offload the pressure and guilt you probably feel about not doing “enough” in your accessibility work. Even if you are a formal program manager in charge of the accessibility programming for an entire organization, it is still not your responsibility alone to ensure accessible products and services. The systems that make you feel that way do so by design, and it’s not your fault.

Emphasizing that people don’t need to be specialists to do accessibility work means that you can facilitate for them instead of policing them.

Potential challenges

Having a small, focused team like an ops team can still have its issues. A lot of these issues will come from expectations people have for “traditional” accessibility programs. Here are some challenges I’ve run into frequently.

Too little responsibility vs. bottlenecking

Accessibility is often already viewed as a checkpoint or a gate instead of a part of the whole. As a result, having an accessibility role or team at all can create the expectation that accessibility practitioners are gatekeepers who will be responsible for reviewing work or approving designs.

People might be afraid that accessibility ops will gatekeep accessibility, but the reality might be the opposite. Teams might feel that the accessibility ops team is too hands off. In the operations scenario, accessibility practitioners offer resources, tools, and support, but it’s ultimately other peoples’ decision to do accessibility work or not, or how to do it. Expecting people to do the work and want to do it consistently and well is going to depend on antiableism being normalized in the organization.

“Scaling” vs. experimentation

What works for one team, division, or organization might not work for another. Traditionally, scaling has meant trying to replicate success with one team across others, where the points of failure are often in relationships, not tools.

The operations model assumes there is at least some uniformity to how teams work. The intention isn’t to manage different activities for different groups, but to provide a single, flexible set of resources, services, and community activities for everyone.

It’s a spin on the agency model, where teams are functionally the clients of the accessibility ops team. That means you get to try out different offerings, tools, and resources, while taking your clients’ needs into consideration. Ultimately, it’s the ops team’s decision as to what they will provide and endorse. Teams can make their own decisions and run their own tools and processes, but the risk is theirs, not the accessibility ops team’s.

Reliance on automation vs. reliance on specialists

“Ops” can conjure the idea of automated tooling to strip teams to their bare minimum. “We don’t need developers to know about accessibility because we have accessibility specialists” becomes “We don’t need developers to know about accessibility because ops manages all the tooling,” for example. This can appear to be an endorsement for accessibility tooling being able to handle all of digital accessibility, which we know is not true.

Instead, this is really about reinforcing that accessibility is something everyone needs to be doing, instead of a specific skill set

that only a few people should have. Individuals need to get used to working in an interdependent whole, where everyone has different responsibilities in relation to accessibility. It’s the job of specialists to provide special help, but it’s the responsibility of non-specialists to to non-special work on their own.

Meeting these challenges

All of the challenges I’ve described are about relationships, not technology. That means that communicating and setting clear boundaries for operations falls on us. If an ops team establishes what it’s focusing on and communicates that clearly across an organization, then there’s less room for people to make assumptions. This means being open, transparent, and honest about what the team is doing and why.

This also means being open to feedback. A lot of us have been personally harmed by deeply ableist feedback we’ve gotten while doing this work. To counter this, the first thing we have to do is teach people how to communicate about disability and accessibility. Accessibility ops efforts need to lead with teaching vocabulary and anti-ableist rhetoric to set a baseline for others to follow.

As we’ve seen over and over, accessibility work boils down to managing resources and relationships in service of fighting ableism. Emphasizing accessibility literacy means that individuals have to take responsibility for their own learning, but they’re supported in doing so.

As I mentioned earlier, “enablement” is a word I keep coming back to when I think about this work. I had the privilege of working with a brilliant research operations manager who used the word to describe our hybrid team, which was made up of UX researchers and myself. We were successful in pushing the idea that we weren’t a dam, but a river. Sure, a person can float down the river without any equipment, but that’s dangerous. It’s better to use a boat. Enablement is giving people a safe, well-maintained boat they can use with the requirement that they still have to steer the boat themselves.

A garden bed

So how do you do accessibility ops? That depends on you and your organization.

The goal is to take traditional program management and turn it into something that actual serves us. It’s about understanding the root causes of why your organization behaves the way it does, and ways you can tap into those behaviors or circumvent them.

If your accessibility practice is a garden bed, this book is about exploring principles and skills you can use to help your garden flourish. All of the techniques you’ll read about next are about being scrappy, pragmatic, and flexible, and about covering your ass, all while learning to identify where you can have the biggest impact in your organization.

In Chapter 8: A traditional accessibility program case study, I’ll tell you a story about an accessibility project early in my career that suffered from a lot of traditional problems. This will help to set a baseline for what we’re going to try to avoid.

In Chapter 9: Communication and coalition, we’ll focus on people. This includes strategies for workplace communication, as well as strategies for finding your people.

In Chapter 10: Service activities, we’ll outline common accessibility services and examine how we can (or can’t) use them through an operations lens.

In Chapter 11: Overview of a program, we’ll start the journey of building and operationalizing a program for the rest of the book. This includes everything from defining what a program is, to what information you can use to make decisions, to setting you up for success in creating and meeting goals. This process emphasizes our pillars of anti-ableism to control what we can and let go of what we can’t.

Chapter summary

This chapter was about benefits and challenges with shifting from traditional accessibility programming to accessibility operations. It outlined the goals and strengths of accessibility ops and gave recommendations for using your knowledge and skills to develop an operations frame of mind. It also provided a brief outline of what the rest of Part 2 holds.

Chapter footnotes

A. A bad faith or uninformed reading may result in thinking that I’m advocating for putting fewer accessibility practitioners in organizations. But the reality is there aren’t a lot of accessibility practitioners working to begin with! Advocating for small, specialized teams isn’t going to lose us jobs. It might actually make more.

Chapter 8: A traditional accessibility program case study

The best way to deduce the system’s purpose is to watch for a while to see how the system behaves.

– Donella H. Meadows in Thinking in Systems

What you’ll read: This is a case study of a program I created early in my career. This program started with a legal threat and an audit, and I think it shows the weaknesses of that approach. Before we dig into how to manage your own practice, I hope this will help to set a bar we can compare future work against.

Background

In the 2010s, A large tech company, A Corp, bought out a smaller one, B Corp. A Corp planned to move B Corp’s brand assets and web content over to their own website. At the time, B Corp was at legal risk because their website was found inaccessible by a disability advocacy group. To avoid further risk, technology leadership at A Corp wanted to find out how accessible their own website was. Their

hope was that they would lower their legal risk just by migrating B Corp’s content to theirs.

The digital agency I worked for at the time was already consulting with A Corp. I was brought on to do an accessibility audit of their primary website. This work was sponsored by a vice president of technology.

Audit findings and results

I did an accessibility audit of the primary user workflows of A Corp’s products. Then I sorted issues into different severity levels based on how I felt the issues would impact users.

Table 4: Example severity levels for accessibility issues

Severity level

Low

Medium

High

Blocking

Meaning

Issue is noticeable and goes against WCAG or other best practices, but isn’t more than an annoyance for users.

Issue causes problems for the user, but they're able to accomplish the task with a workaround.

Issue causes problems for the user, to the point where they are likely to give up or abandon the task.

Issue prevents the user from completing their task or may cause harm to the user.

During the audit, I found multiple high severity and blocking accessibility issues in A Corp’s products. I compiled the issues in a spreadsheet. I then wrote a report and shared it with the sponsor and his team.

We met to discuss what next steps I would recommend. The project was then extended so I could help A Corp address the issues I found.

Proposed workflow

After I delivered the audit and discussed the results with the project sponsor, the sponsor wanted a proposed timeline for remediation. Based on prior experience, I knew that just fixing issues was not going to prevent teams from creating more barriers. It also wouldn’t address issues within the organization that let those barriers happen in the first place.

I wanted to address the client’s concern about remediation, but I also wanted to address more systemic changes I thought were necessary to make accessibility work more sustainable.

To do this, I suggested a four-phase project that would lead into a more permanent accessibility program:

Ĉ. Audit (which was already complete)

ĉ. Training

Ċ. Remediation

ċ. Systems

Figure 12: My proposed workflow.

Training

I recommended that product teams receive training about accessibility to help avoid issues in future work. My goal was to teach digital accessibility basics to all of the teams. This would let

teams all start with the same knowledge and inform them on how to fix simple accessibility issues.

Then I would dig into more intermediate topics for each team, using the accessibility issues they had created. This would help them learn information that was extremely relevant for their jobs. Finally, I would continue to provide coaching while teams began work on the next phase, remediation. My hope was that they would learn the bulk of what they needed to know for remediation through training, and then I could help them with the more complex issues.

Remediation

During remediation, product teams would complete work to address accessibility issues across the product. They would prioritize issues that had Blocking or High severity.

During this phase, teams would also take note of pain points in their processes. I would then follow up with them to identify ways we could reduce those pain points in the following phase, Systems.

Systems

Product teams at A Corp would change how they work to better meet the needs of disabled users. This would mean updating systems like tooling, training, and processes to make accessibility work more effective and continuous. This improvement would be ongoing as the organization grew and acquired new tools and resources.

Realities

The plan I proposed made sense to me as a practitioner. But it was a hard sell because of realities at the organization. Here are a few of the issues that we had to address in the organization climate and culture. A

Different team climates

Product teams in A Corp had high levels of autonomy, and they all worked differently.

Some teams had more engineers and designers, which gave them more capacity to work. But those same teams also had more pressure to ship new features because they were already high-performing, which led to those teams getting more resources, performing better, and getting more pressure, and so on.

Some teams focused more on research and design, while others focused more on development.

Every team worked in a separate code base, so while they were using similar design patterns, they were not implementing features in the same way.

As a result of all of these differences, each team had its own climate around how it functioned day to day. There was no core set of processes and workflows that all teams used and built on for their own purposes. This would make identifying gaps and opportunities for improvement in processes more difficult.

Conflicting priorities

The sponsor and product teams had priorities that conflicted with each other. These priorities were interconnected with the organization’s culture and existing conflicts in the organization.

Sponsor priorities The sponsor’s top priority was to start remediation as soon as possible. A Corp and the organization threatening to sue set a soft 1-year deadline for remediation. Hitting this deadline would help reduce risk for A Corp. The sponsor asked me what would be needed to start remediation right away. I said that I would need support to do training as well as remediation, since remediation without training wouldn’t solve anything.

The sponsor’s second priority was to move all the product teams to the same design system and component library. This was not part of the stated goal of the project. However, the sponsor felt it would help to sell accessibility to product owners. He expressed that his team had been struggling to get product teams on board with a design system. They had tried reduced bugs, security issues, and time to ship as motivators. However, these motivators didn’t outweigh the amount of time that product leads feared the teams would “lose” to onboarding to a system.

I agreed that, if done correctly, using a single design system could help reduce (but not eliminate) future accessibility issues.

Product priorities

Meanwhile, the product owners’ (POs) top priority was to follow the roadmap they had already agreed to for the year. This meant that introducing “new” work would put their deadlines at risk. In this case, “new” work included accessibility remediation and onboarding to the new design system.

This emphasis on shipping was reinforced by new senior leadership, changes in the economy, and changes in A Corp and B Corp’s industry. Together, these changes had shaped a new, more aggressive organizational culture very recently.

This change in culture, in turn, affected the organizational climate. Teams were now racing with each other to sell services to customers. This sense of urgency impacted both people and product.

UX designers and engineers experienced an environment of constant low-level anxiety. They often expressed to me that they were under a lot of pressure to deliver product updates and small changes to constantly improve conversion numbers (that is, the number of customers purchasing services).

This also contributed to fragile designs and code. At the time, teams relied heavily on A/B testing to make decisions about updates to the product. C They used an A/B testing framework that ran on top of their production code to deploy different versions of features to users. If one of the options performed better in testing, it was much easier to simply crank the “winning” option to 100% in the framework instead of updating the code in the actual product code base. This meant that some accessibility issues “lived” in the A/B

testing framework and not in the actual codebase, which would make fixes more complex.

My priority My top priority remained training. I knew from prior experience that the organization would continue to be at legal risk after remediation if people did not know how to avoid making accessibility mistakes in the first place.

A revised plan

To address these competing concerns, I worked with the sponsor and my mentor to come up with a revised plan. The new post-audit plan still included remediation, training, and systems work, but these streams would overlap.

Training revised

I was able to convince the sponsor that training was critical. However, the plan to work with teams one at a time meant that everyone would need training at different times. This would be difficult for me to accomplish while also providing remediation support. To address this, the sponsor offered to hire an additional vendor to provide introductory training. The plan was that each team would receive training, then focus on remediation with me, one after the other.

Remediation revised

To help address teams’ concerns about scheduling and priorities, we would set specific timeframes for each team to focus on accessibility work. To determine what order teams would go in, we considered risk. I collaborated with the sponsor to assess which products had the most users and thus carried the most risk by being inaccessible for longer.

We reviewed the user traffic for each team’s product. We then planned to work with the team with most traffic, followed by the second-most traffic, and so on. Not incidentally, the amount of traffic coincided with the amount of revenue each team made the company. This also coincided with which teams had the most resources. This would come into play later.

Systems revised

Since there was no agreed-upon process that all teams followed, it became clear that I would need to embed with each team during remediation to learn about their processes and workflows. I would then use this information to inform collaboration with the new design system team after working with product teams.

I would also need to determine ways to make not just accessibility work but also accessibility learning more systemic in the organization. I would investigate options for training that fit the organization’s current culture around learning.

Figure 13: A revised diagram for the revised plan.

Division of labor

To address this new plan, we divided labor in the following ways.

Technology and Product

The sponsor would communicate the proposed timeframes to product owners. He would then be responsible for getting and maintaining buy-in with those leaders. To help with day-to-day communications with the additional vendor, the sponsor brought in a temporary program manager.

Vendors

The additional vendor would be responsible for providing the same introductory accessibility training to each team.

After each team received training, I would embed with them support remediation. Once each team went through training and remediation, I would switch gears to focus on systems-level work.

Outputs and outcomes

Once the plan was agreed upon by all of the stakeholders, work began in the three streams we created.

Friction and resistance

Because of the competing priorities and scheduling challenges I described, the program was a hard sell. Understandably, no one wanted to redo work on things that have already shipped. Remediation and long training workshops were an even harder sell, especially when they might take place in an illogical order.

Ultimately, the sponsor prevailed with executive support because this work was to address a very real legal threat. Nonetheless, this left a large amount of friction with myself and the sponsor on one side and the product owners (and sometimes product team members) on the other. The amount of friction changed over time as activities began to flow more into teams’ existing processes and workflows.

Friction remained for as long as teams felt randomized and interrupted. This coincided with different types of activities.

Figure 14: Friction and resistance over time.

Episodic activities

At the beginning of the program, activities tended to be episodic. These activities interrupted processes and workflows, created a lot of short-term changes in teams’ activities, and caused friction and resistance. In the short term, teams had to do a lot of context switching. This required a lot of support from me and a lot of coordination between myself, the temporary program manager, the training vendor, and product teams.

Over approximately the first two thirds of the project, resistance increased as teams’ schedules and work continued to be affected by episodic activities.

Episodic training activities

The vendor that the sponsor hired successfully delivered introductory training to all of the product teams. However, there were some negative impacts.

The vendor used traditional in-person accessibility workshops to teach. These workshops lasted multiple full days, which caused interruptions in teams’ schedules.

These trainings also had to be staggered throughout the year based on teams’ other priorities as well as the instructor’s availability. This meant that training did not line up neatly with the priority order we’d created. Some teams received training before remediation, but others got training at the same time they were working with me, and others got training after working with me.

Product team members reported getting value out of the training, but this depended heavily on individuals’ learning styles, stress levels, and timing of the training. Any material that wasn’t covered in training, wasn’t understood, or hadn’t been taught yet fell to me to teach informally during remediation support.

Episodic remediation activities

I worked directly with each team for several weeks to help them do remediation, one after the other. I provided hands-on coaching on a day-to-day basis. We prioritized work on high severity, high impact, and high effort accessibility issues first, with the hope that these could be addressed while I was embedded with the team. Teams

then continued to work on lower severity, lower priority, and lower complexity issues as I moved on.

Because of the short timeframe, most teams resorted to bug bashes (short sprints to focus on bugs), which had mixed success and efficacy in addressing the issues. This approach meant there was an emphasis on closing issues quickly rather than well. Sometimes teams did this without my help and only reached out for me to validate closed issues. As a result, I sometimes had to re-open issues to have teams try again.

The level of support I had to provide varied across teams, based on the number of issues the team had, how busy the teams were with other priorities, and how familiar teams were with basic accessibility principles by the time I worked with them.

Teams that had more of a focus on user experience also had an easier time adapting to new information. Teams that focused less on user experience had a harder time. This, plus the staggered training schedule, put extra pressure on me to teach informally while I was doing remediation support.

Additionally, I often found myself continuing to provide support to the team I had just “left.” Teams always had fixes they had to roll back or concerns about upcoming features that they wanted my input on. This was good news from the perspective of teams thinking ahead to systems-level work, but it made remediation support challenging.

Episodic systems activities

Because of how teams needed different levels of remediation support, I was able to dig deeper into processes and workflows with some teams but not others.

However, I was able to feel confident about identifying possible accessibility champions. When time allowed, I partnered with these folks to prototype ideas they had for changing their team’s processes. The goal was for these individuals to try out the prototypes with their teams and then socialize them with other teams if they were helpful.

These prototypes included:

An accessibility requirements checklist for project managers to complete over the course of a project

Annotation guidelines for UX designers to hand off to front-end engineers, using existing tools and processes

Tools for front-end engineers to run accessibility checks during the development process

Customized automated accessibility testing to be performed by QA test engineers to supplement testing by front-end engineers

Continuous activities

At this point, the highest priority remediation work was now out of the way and all teams had gone through training with the additional vendor.

As the project continued, I was able to begin to shift the organization to doing more continuous accessibility activities. Continuous activities tend to reduce friction because they interweave with existing activities. This happened alongside reduced friction as teams got used to their new tools and processes.

This reduced friction meant I didn’t have to hold peoples’ hands quite as much. They could do more activities on their own, which made activities more continuous and streamlined. Resistance decreased as these activities smoothed out into workers’ normal plans and workflows.

By the end of the project, nearly all activities had either been discontinued or had become continuous. Remediation activities stopped being one-offs and instead got absorbed into emerging training and systems work. We continued to develop training materials and systems-level tools and resources, which often intermixed.

Continuous training

As I originally promised, I designed a set of accessibility training modules to run on A Corp’s existing learning management system (LMS). These trainings would be taken annually, along with security training, and would reinforce accessibility basics.

Design systems testing and support

As another result of the lowered resistance and friction, I could dedicate time to working with the organization’s new design system team.

I worked with a colleague to do an assessment of the components the team had designed and built so far. These team members had mostly come from other organizations and had a stronger grasp on accessibility, which was extremely helpful.

Embedded documentation

I worked with the team to make improvements and add documentation in the design system. I mentored a colleague who worked on an accessibility guide that would be part of the design system documentation. This way, people could dip into the documentation as needed and learn how to use the components safely. The team would continue to update this resource as they expanded the design system.

Ongoing testing

A Corp engaged a vendor to do ongoing accessibility testing support, including testing for internal resources. This would help keep the organization accountable to the disability advocacy organization.

An accessibility team

The final change was to create a permanent accessibility team. This team would sit with the design system team. Together, they would provide ongoing testing, training, and coaching support for product teams. I assisted with hiring and supporting specialists on this new team as they started.

With a shift to more continuous activities and management by a team with services, this point signaled that the project had become a formal program. This program would continue to shift and grow as the organization’s needs changed over time.

Figure 15: How it actually went.

Measurements of progress

With the creation of a more sustainable solution to A Corp’s accessibility problem, we have a clear milestone we can use to measure what progress we made during the project. To do this, I’ll use two metrics: accessibility literacy, and accessibility maturity.

Accessibility literacy

One way to measure improvement around accessibility work is with accessibility literacy. Accessibility literacy gauges how able a person is to do accessibility work on their own.

Accessibility Literacy Framework (ALF)

ALF has two parts: frames and stages.

Each frame maps to a facet of accessibility literacy. The frames are:

Guidelines and practices

Authority

Tools and resources

Information seeking

Anti-ableism

Each stage maps to certain ways of thinking and doing around each frame. The stages are:

None: People with no literacy don’t know the correct place to start.

Low: This stage focuses on vocabulary and requires a lot of support from specialists. This allows individuals to start to learn how to research and communicate.

Medium: This stage is about helping people get more comfortable with vetting trustworthy sources and authorities and start to work more independently.

High: The final stage involves understanding nuance in the accessibility space and a high level of autonomy. People at this stage often contribute to the field themselves.

With these frames and stages we can assess a person’s accessibility literacy at a point in time. c

To demonstrate this, I have estimated the accessibility literacy of four people participants at the beginning and end of the project:

Ĉ. A project manager

ĉ. A UX designer

Ċ. A front-end engineer

ċ. A QA engineer

For each person, I have created a table and spider chart comparing their literacy at the start and end of the project. The tables include evidence for each literacy stage.

Project manager (PM)

A PM, who had recently joined A Corp, worked with one of the first teams prioritized for remediation and training. They were expecting me to give them instructions to access a test tool, and that would be the end of it. They were still learning the ropes of their new job but were surprised that there were not already accessibility protocols in place at A Corp. They had come from an organization that had a higher level of accessibility maturity.

User experience designer (UX)

A UX designer had recently joined A Corp after finishing a master’s program in UX. They had some familiarity with accessibility from their previous career as a mechanical engineer as well as experience living with disabled family members.

They had concerns about how designers at A Corp didn’t have a lot of day-to-day interactions with engineers. For example, all of the UX designers sat together in a pod, instead of with the engineers in

their respective product teams. They were eager to work accessibility into processes they already wanted to improve.

Front-end engineer (FE)

This FE was a member of the team that was the highest priority for remediation. The fact that the was prioritized didn’t surprise the engineer; their team’s product was the most lucrative at A Corp. As a result, the team was pushed to do ever more refined testing of their product, with a focus on getting more customers instead of making the product stable. This engineer focused on JavaScript templating and had little background or interest in semantic markup.

Figure 19: The accessibility literacy of the QA test engineer at the beginning and end of the project.

Maturity

To measure the improvement of the organization rather than individuals, we can use an accessibility maturity model. D This model measures changes in accessibility programs over time and maps them to stages.

To do this, I’ll be using the W3C’s Maturity Model. While the W3C’s Maturity Model wasn’t published at the time, I can use hindsight to estimate A Corp’s accessibility maturity at the end of the project using this tool. 1

This model has four stages:

Ĉ. Inactive: There is no recognition of the need for accessibility

ĉ. Launch: There is some awareness and the beginning of planning around accessibility

Ċ. Integrate: There is an organized approach and a roadmap

ċ. Optimize: The organization is wholly on board and now focusing on continuous improvement

Because there was no organization-wide work on accessibility happening before this project started, we’ll use the Inactive maturity stage for the start of the organization’s journey.

To calculate A Corp’s maturity, I used the W3C Accessibility Maturity Model Spreadsheet. 2 To review a copy of my calculations, visit book.dpersing.com.

If we look at the stages of the maturity model as a spectrum from 0% (Inactive) to 100% (Optimize), and where each stage takes up a quarter of the spectrum, this puts A Corp in the Inactive stage for several, the Launch stage for fewer, and the Integrate stage for one dimension.

Figure 20: The maturity ratings for each dimension and an average of the dimensions.

I think these results reflect a few things about the project.

The project focused primarily on remediation of a user-facing product. This meant that the bulk of our efforts went toward addressing gaps in the SDLC of A Corp. As a result, this dimension received the highest rating. The next highest rated dimension, Knowledge and skills, was the area we focused on as a secondary

goal. Areas that we did not address, or areas that received focus only to support the remediation project have much lower ratings.

These skewed results are an example of what can happen when an organization tackles one area of accessibility work instead of facilitating growth in multiple areas.

Instead of having rapid growth around the company’s product forcing growth in other areas, an ideal scenario would address accessibility throughout the organization. This would bring up all of the dimensions together and demonstrate a more holistic approach to making accessibility part of the climate and culture of the organization.

Chapter summary

This chapter was a case study. It followed an accessibility project that began with a focus on compliance and ended with the creation of a permanent accessibility program. It described how the organization had conflicting priorities that made doing accessibility work under duress difficult. It also described how activities that were episodic and reactive tended to randomize teams and create resistance, while continuous, proactive activities flowed better and caused less resistance.

The case study used tools like the Accessibility Literacy Framework (ALF) and the Accessibility Maturity Model to measure the organization’s progress.

Overall, the project demonstrated positive change but at the cost of an uneven distribution of growth around accessibility, with a large amount of growth for areas we focused on and little for those we didn’t.

Chapter 9: Communication and coalition

Interviewee: I've found that the higher up you go in an organization with this message, the more friction you'll encounter and the more reluctance to make change. I've had positive experiences with managers. I've had some positive experiences with directors. Some. As you keep moving around horizontally at the director space, and then you keep going up vertically to VPs and above, it's like you have to prove yourself so much harder than any other level, any other role. It's really bizarre.

What you’ll read: In this chapter, you’ll explore different communication needs that people might have. You’ll also learn about the types of documents and other deliverables that people in your organization might want from you, and ways you can collect data from these interactions. Finally, you’ll consider ways to identify people you can collaborate with toward your goals.

A great deal of accessibility work is about communicating with people. Part of this is related to teaching. But a lot of it is about coalition building, which requires collaboration.

To see who you can collaborate with, you first have to communicate with people. It’s the only way to gauge people’s interest as you grow

your initiative or program. Basically, you need to figure out who gives a shit about accessibility and disabled people and find the best way to work with them.

Communication is a skill

“But, Devon!” you might say. “I am shy, neurodivergent, and/or a hermit. I would literally rather die than talk to people, much less give a presentation or write a report. How can I avoid this entirely while doing accessibility work?” I’m sorry to say that you can’t. I too am neurodivergent, and I have hermit-like qualities. To get better at work communication, I had to convince myself that doing communication at work is “real” work. Communicating at work is a skill that comes with practice and understanding your audience. A

None of this is written in stone. Do not treat these suggestions as rules. There will always be times when doing things in the “correct” channels or in the “right” way is not the answer. And, remember that everything you write or share within an organizational using official organization tools is not private (more on that later).

To that end, let’s talk about some ways to approach communication.

Materials

All of the materials and information you create and deliver (which are often called “deliverables”) should be variations on a theme. Avoid completely creating new content whenever you can, because it will save you a lot of time.

Different package, same content

Think about materials as different packages for the same content or message. Also think about ways you can connect different people to your content and resources. For example, if your organization’s video sharing tool has a description box, link to the resources you mention in the video. If the platform supports transcripts, you can also link to these resources in the body of that content. Different people will respond to these different ways of sharing the same information, giving you more chances for people to learn on their own.

Communication styles are unique

Consider the communication and learning styles of people you talk with. While certain audiences typically benefit from certain types of communication or resources, don’t ignore evidence that a particular person might benefit from a different type. The more you work with a person, the easier it will be for you to get a handle on what they respond to and what they don’t.

Accessible documents

Don’t forget to make your deliverables as accessible as you can. Use headings in documents. Use the plainest language you can that’s appropriate for your audience and message. Use descriptive, consistent link text. Provide accurate alt text, captions, and transcripts for media. You know the drill.

If your organization doesn’t have infrastructure to make your materials accessible, do the best you can, and use that inaccessible infrastructure as a learning opportunity for others. The ticket to getting people on board might be to address internal accessibility and how it affects disabled employees or the perceived lack thereof.

Let’s go through some common materials and considerations for them.

Miscellaneous written communications

Most of your communications will be in email, your organization’s messaging app of choice, or ticketing systems. Be courteous, brief, and honest, and try to follow whatever your organization’s norms are for these types of interactions. These communications are also a gold mine for reusing material, which we’ll talk about in a bit.

Presentations

Exactly how you do presentations will depend a great deal on how you prefer to present and the culture of your organization. But I do want to make a few recommendations for presenting information about accessibility in particular.

Give yourself extra time to prepare

Presentations always take more time to prepare than you think they will. Even an informal presentation like a lunchtime question and answer session requires preparation to have a good idea of what your audience needs, and what takeaways you want to give them.

Define your terms

Give definitions and examples for accessibility-related terms people might not be familiar with, even if you’re speaking to an audience you think might be more advanced. You want to define things in other deliverables too, but presentations are kind of a special case. If a person is watching a video or reading an article, it’s easier for them to look things up when they need to.

Giving definitions in your presentation will make it less likely that folks will look them up on their phones while you’re talking or that they’ll lose interest by not understanding.

Use internal guidelines and standards

Your organization might have guidelines or standard slide decks or other materials for formal presentations. Follow these guidelines to the letter and use or adapt the standard materials, even if they are ugly, inaccessible by default, or a pain to use.

Leave your audience with resources

Create a resource guide or “learn more” document to go with your presentation. This can be an outline or script that you write and then turn into a slide deck, or something you create after the slide deck or other materials are complete.

The guide should include or link to any presentation materials, so it can act as a kind of hub for your presentation. That way, you can share just the resource guide to give people access to all of the

resources and information. You can also recycle it into other types of documentation that people can discover on their own.

Prepare to get less time to present

Ahead of time, you’ll often be told that you have X number of minutes for your presentation. But five minutes before you go on, you’ll be told you actually have Y minutes, and Y is much less than X. Or precious minutes of your talk will get eaten up by audience questions about basic accessibility topics. It’s just the reality of things.

One of two things will happen if you’ve been asked to make a presentation shorter than you planned.

Ĉ. The first time this happens, you will probably try to deliver all

the information you prepared in less time. This means talking fast and trying to summarize information on the fly. This can be extremely nerve-wracking, especially if you’re not used to doing presentations.

ĉ. The other option is to have a secret, shorter version of your

presentation ready to go. This will mean having practiced skipping some details and skipping some slides or materials altogether.

The more you present, the easier it gets to have that shorter version ready to go in your brain. Some people even do presentations from one giant slide deck that they adjust for a given audience. Lean into

the way that you feel more comfortable doing this, and just know it will get easier with practice.

Videos

Text is usually the most accessible and adaptable format for most people. It’s adaptable and translatable, and most of your deliverables will come down to text or a mix of text and images. But some organizational cultures put emphasis on other formats, like video, and sometimes people prefer to learn that way.

Recordings

Default to making your recording of a training session or presentation available for people to find and review. You can put these recordings in your organization’s sharing platform so they are discoverable. You can also send them directly to people who come to you with similar requests.

A lot of people won’t watch the full recording for a meeting or training they missed, but they might skim the transcript, or watch a few minutes at a specific timestamp. Skimming is totally okay! If you’ve made content that people can easily skim and still take away the right ideas, you’re doing really well.

Pitch videos

If you make a video to pitch an idea, keep it between 1 and 3 minutes. This video is an introduction to or summary of a larger

deliverable. Examples of deliverables that might have pitch videos are presentations, reports, or proposals.

Pitch videos don’t have to stand completely alone, so they are a good way to practice sharing more detailed resources and materials with people. They should focus on what specific actions a person should take after watching the video or reading its transcript.

Proposals

Proposals are written to convince others to start something new. The something new might be to start a project, kick off an initiative, establish a program, create a role, acquire a resource, or make another change.

Your organization might have a template or instructions for creating proposals. Learn those standards and use them to the point of malicious compliance if you have to. If you follow the rules for documents like proposals, you’re less likely to get pushback on technicalities. That means people have to engage with your actual ideas instead of questioning if you met the requirements of the proposal.

This is another great opportunity to recycle material and repackage it for a different audience. If you know of a successful initiative or program in your organization, especially one that’s adjacent to accessibility work, get a copy of that proposal and use it as a template.

Reports

Reports are a way to communicate about things that are happening or have happened. Like proposals, reports can check compliance boxes when you are trying to get people to engage with your ideas, or trying to demonstrate that you are taking a project, program, or initiative seriously.

At some point you will probably need to write or contribute to a report on accessibility efforts in your organization. Leadership may ask you for this directly. You also might find managers or leaders asking for the same information over and over again.

If you’ve never written a formal report before, don’t panic. It’s actually pretty easy and can give you content you can reuse for years to come. And to be clear, this isn’t doing the same work over and over again because no one is paying attention. This is a way for you to demonstrate what you’re accomplishing more efficiently and reach the widest audience you can.

Executive summary

An executive summary is a short description of the main points of the report, designed for very busy people to skim.

You’ll often find it easiest to write the executive summary last, after you know what is in your report. This will save you time in rewriting.

But what if you’re not sure what your report is supposed to say? Another way to use an executive summary to your advantage is to give yourself some time to draft an executive summary first. This will help you narrow down to your main takeaways. Then you can work

backwards and figure out what information you need to support those points. This can help keep you on the rails when you’re spiraling over what information to include and what to leave out.

Background

The background section is a brief narrative about how you arrived at writing the report. It might include general information like statistics, legal rulings, or history in your industry or field that has led you to push for accessibility in your organization. The goal of this section is to situate what your report is about in a larger context.

Argument/Purpose

This is the main part of your report. If you learned how to write a 5part essay in school (an intro, three points, and a conclusion), the argument is the three points.

You want to be able to answer a few questions.

Ĉ. Why are you writing the report?

ĉ. What information are you trying to impart?

Ċ. Why should people care?

ċ. What evidence do you have?

Č. What does your audience need to know?

č. What decision do they need to make with the information you’re providing?

Paradoxically, this section should still be as brief as possible. You can make it briefer by linking to or referencing things like tickets, audit reports, outputs from pilot projects, etc. This helps offload some of this content that people will often not read in full anyway.

It may also be useful to share diagrams of proposed workflows or how these resources fit together along with these references. People may take screenshots and share them out of context of the report (more on that later), so making this section as airtight and easy to understand as possible is important.

Other documentation

If you want people to discover things you make on their own, put them where they expect to find them. This often means contributing to internal documentation like craft handbooks, wikis, learning management systems (LMS), or technical documentation in a version control system like Git.

If you have the same information in multiple formats, such as a video recording, a slide deck, and a resource guide, store all of these together or link them to each other. This gives people multiple ways to engage with the content if they discover it on their own. It also helps you from losing track of different versions or formats.

Audiences

Now let’s talk about people. Get a sense of who someone is and what they do before you reach out to them. This includes having a

good sense of what people in their role do in general at your organization, as well as what this person does in particular.

Internal wikis or directories are a good way to find a profile of the person, as well as information about any teams they are a part of. You might also be able to find out about specific projects they work on, and so on.

Here are a few questions that can help you guide your search.

What is this person’s role in the organization?

What power does this person have in the organization?

What resources does this person have access to?

What do you need or want from this person for your work to be successful?

What might this person need from you to get that done?

What you need from this person and what they might need from you will vary widely based on their role. Here are some examples of things you might need from them:

Resources, such as budget, headcount, tools, or buy-in to help push the message to leadership Expertise in something that is outside your wheelhouse Sponsorship for specific projects or initiatives Collaboration to continue to grow your coalition

And here are some examples of things they might need from you:

Data on disabled users Information on laws and regulations Training about accessibility and disability Mentorship to grow in the accessibility space Support or collaboration on a project or initiative

For our purposes, I’m dividing up people by roles and levels of responsibility commonly found in organizations. You will need to adapt this based on how your own organization is structured.

Figure 21: The higher up the pyramid you go, the further you are from grassroots efforts but the more authority you have to make real lasting change.

Individual contributors (ICs)

ICs are people like designers, engineers, and specialists of all kinds. They are responsible for delivering the organization’s products or services.

This group represents the bottom of our organization pyramid. They typically have the least power in the organization, and they are the last people to hear about anything. However, there are a lot of them. This is the core group to target for any type of grassroots accessibility efforts.

If you reach out to ICs to talk about accessibility work, they will want to know how any new information will affect them and their role. If you approach them with an initiative or pilot program idea, they’ll want to know if their manager knows about this. Will they have the support and resources they need to participate? Is this part of a larger initiative they should be paying attention to?

A more likely scenario is that ICs will reach out to you. They will hear about you from someone else you’ve already worked with, or they’ll have seen a video or a presentation you made. They will be looking for training, mentorship, and support in doing accessibility work. You can use these interactions to gauge their level of accessibility literacy and to think about how you might be able to collaborate on larger efforts.

Managers and owners (PM/POs)

Next is the layer of middle management, with the Ps: project managers, program managers, product owners, and people managers, which I’ll shorten to PM/POs. I’m not going to go into

details on these individual roles because they vary widely across organizations. Suffice to say, PM/POs are often the linchpins of teams. Their job is communication. They also have the power to make your ideas for processes, workflows, or tooling a reality.

PM/POs will want to know details about how impacts on their team. If you are asking them about trying out a testing tool or a workflow with their team, they will want to know how they can do that with the least friction possible in their current release schedule. If you want to run a pilot project with their team, they’ll want to know who on their team will be the point person for it.

PM/POs need to know how to prioritize and rationalize anything you ask of them to higher ups. If they are newer to the organization, they might be skittish to do something that’s not formally mandated. If they are more established and have demonstrated success, they will be more likely to experiment.

People managers

People managers are a special case. In this category, I’m putting people like design leads, engineering leads, and team leads. Unlike other types of PM/POs, people managers have the primary job of managing people rather than products or processes.

They have the power and influence to impact individual outcomes for ICs, but they are also the messenger for any information that comes from leadership, regardless of their feelings on it. If you approach a people manager about accessibility, they will want to

know how they can support the people that report to them. They’ll want to know how you will support them too.

But these are the people who can often give insight into where their team’s climate and the organization’s culture meet. They are also very familiar with the learning resources for each role, as well as requirements for promotion or growth. They also have a lot of exposure to the organization’s politics. A good ally in people management can often help you cut through some of the organization’s bullshit because this is something they have to do to be successful too.

Leadership

Members of leadership need to be involved if you are trying to build a formal initiative or program because formal work requires changes in organizational culture. These folks might be in the Csuite or people with things like “president” and “director” in their titles. People in leadership are usually responsible for large numbers of people and processes in the organization, including products and whole disciplines, like UX or engineering.

If you tell someone in leadership that there is a problem in the organization, they will want to hear that you have a plan to address it. They care about “impact,” not (usually) so much about process and details. They want to know who’s already bought in, what resources are needed, what’s the timeline. They want to know how what you want demonstrates alignment with business objectives in

the context of the market, the core mission, and the organization’s stated values.

Other internal staff

There is always going to be someone left out of a communication who should have been brought in. This is especially the case if:

The organization is very large

The organization is very bureaucratic

There has been a lot of turnover or reorganization recently

The organization’s culture encourages silos of knowledge and responsibility

This gets even trickier when your organization has a lot of internal teams. For example, your organization might have teams for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); human resources (HR); customer or client support; operations; tooling; or change management. Your work will intersect with theirs at some point. The same rules for communicating with them apply. Know what you think you need from them and be ready to give something in exchange. At the very least, you need to be able to cooperate with these folks. Ideally, you can collaborate with them and form a coalition for your common goals.

There are no secrets

Any time you give a document or resource to someone, assume they will share it with others. It might get shared horizontally with peers or vertically to management and leadership. ICs will often share resources with their team, including their team lead or manager, or peers on other teams. PM/POs will often share resources with other managers or directors. Directors will often share things with senior leaders, and so on.

Usually, this has positive outcomes. For example, it can lead to people reaching out to you with offers of support or sponsorship. It can also lead you to resources or institutional knowledge that you didn’t know to look for. Some of the best collaborators I’ve had have been people who popped out of the woodwork seemingly at random.

However, information sharing can also have negative outcomes.

What not to do

Here’s a story I’m not proud of to illustrate this point. Once, a director asked me for some talking points about accessibility for an upcoming discussion he was having with members of senior leadership. I was drowning in work, but I told him I could get him some notes and resources. He said that would be great.

Normally, when communicating with a director, I would go more formal or polished than what the request seems to indicate, but I did not have the time. I put together a document with evidence for the usual pro-accessibility arguments: the moral/human rights argument, the legal argument, the market argument. I included

quotes from experts in the space, relevant government agencies, and news articles.

I also included summaries and links to formal internal reports a colleague and I wrote. It was basically a loosely organized outline of arguments for formalizing accessibility work in my words, with quotes and resources.

I delivered this document to him and reiterated that it had information and talking points for him to use, but was not official and shouldn’t be shared directly with others. He said, ”Thanks!”

Later that day, I saw an email in my inbox. It was from the director to a member of the C-suite, with myself and my manager cc’ed. The email said that we had a plan to address accessibility, and the Csuite person would find information on why we were doing this attached. The attachment was, you guessed it, my hasty page of notes that literally said, in the text, that it was not a formal report to be shared directly with leadership, but a collection of notes to be used in discussion.

I don’t know if he ever got a reply to the email. Was this a missed opportunity? Probably. It was a learning experience for me, at the very least.

I think both the director and I made mistakes. All things considered, it would have looked better for me to just share the formal reports and proposals I’d already written, or a shiny slide deck summarizing them. I also should have pushed more to find out the exact purpose

for the director’s request, and he should have given me more transparency.

Be specific and open

To help avoid the type of scenario I just described, always be extremely up front and specific about who a deliverable is for, and what it’s meant to convey. It is also another opportunity to reuse information in multiple formats. Some folks will want an in-depth report. Others will just want the executive summary. Others will want a slide deck.

It’s always okay to ask what kind of information a person is looking for and what the best format for them is. It’s good and necessary to ask questions and push back to get more information, especially when you feel like you can’t. Assume that people will find your work whether you want them to or not, so plan accordingly.

That all said, follow your organization’s knowledge management guidelines for storing documents on things like SharePoint and Google Drive if you have such guidelines. These types of services often let you see who accesses a document, which can give you leads on coalition too.

Tracking communications

Any time you have an interaction with someone about accessibility, you have two objectives:

Ĉ. Be honest and open about the subject so people find it approachable.

ĉ. Consider how this person might be able to be a helper in coalition.

Here are some ideas on making this part of your daily work.

Keep a two-way paper trail

Even if you track your work in a ticket system, you know that there are always more requests and “quick” questions. DMs, hallway discussions, and the like usually fall through the cracks but take up a lot of our time.

Track this stuff too. This can feel like a lot of overhead, but I promise it will pay off. The goal here is to keep a record of who you’ve talked to, how it went, and what the outcome was. This will help you begin to see patterns in how people respond (or don’t) to your work. It can also help you avoid asking the same person the same thing within a few weeks or months if you forget!

Start doing this before someone asks for it or before it feels like you “need” to. This type of information has been critical for me in conversations with skeptical or burnt-out managers and directors. This is the direct evidence showing that you’re overworked, randomized, or under-resourced.

Here are some things to track:

Date of the interaction

Format of the interaction (DM, email, meeting, hallway, request ticket, etc.)

Person’s name, role and position or team in the organization What they want from you What you want from them What they need to do what you want Next steps or outcomes Any follow-up you did or need to do

You can put this information into a spreadsheet or sort it into cards and look for trends. Trends I’ve found this way include:

The days of the week or month people tend to ask for help Where people are in their product development life cycle (PDLC) when they ask for help What teams are asking a lot of questions What issues people are struggling with

Any and all information like this is data you can use for making decisions later, which we'll talk about later in this book.

Do you need to do this for every interaction? Probably not. If you feel overwhelmed or struggle with remembering to track your day-to-day work, try doing it for a day, or a week. A month later, do another week, and so on.

Write scripts

One way to make communication easier is to write scripts. C Scripts are a way for you to reuse emails, messages, and any other communications you find yourself repeating a lot.

Devin Owsley, an accessibility designer, emphasized the importance of scripts in their communications to me.

As a neurodivergent person, it really helps me to have a script that I can adjust. I don't have to waste a lot of emotional energy going into that.

That is one thing that I brought [into accessibility work] out of product management. I templatize every format of email that I could possibly need to send out, and then I would tweak it and then it would be out and on time.

I had 40 plus clients that I was working with [at the time], so I was just constantly sending emails and agendas and recap notes. It was incessant. I never want to do that again at that level. But honestly, that's helping you get to the next step because you're modeling what good boundaries look like.

Write scripts for yourself for crafting DMs, posts, emails, and inperson interactions. The goal isn’t to stiffly stick to the script for consistency for other people (although it doesn’t hurt). It’s for you, so you’re not reinventing your pitch, response, or thank you message every time, or stressing about voice and tone.

This helps offset some of the cognitive load of communicating with different people all day. If you have a script for a particular type of interaction, you’re less likely to forget something or respond in a way that doesn’t fit the situation. It helps you do people work even on the days when that’s the last thing you want to do.

If you have a colleague who excels at communication, share the idea of writing scripts with them, and perhaps you can get some good feedback.

Here’s an example script for reaching out to a project manager to, say, get some information on a project launch.

Introduce yourself (if you haven’t before) or re-introduce yourself if it’s been a while

Say exactly what that person can do to help you

Say why you’re reaching out to them specifically

Say exactly how urgent the request is

Say the best way for them to follow up with you

Thank them for their help and welcome any questions they have

Here's an example.

“Hi Sara! I’m so-and-so, an accessibility specialist with the UX operations team. No rush, but I wanted to connect because I think we have an opportunity to collaborate.

I’ve been running monthly workshops for the design system team around accessibility, and we’ve worked on some updates

for the design system documentation. I know from talking to Steve that you have been doing a lot of work to document accessibility for your own team, and I’d love to get your feedback on the documentation we’ve been doing. I’m also interested in learning more about the documentation your team is using and what you’ve found useful.

Also, if I can be of any help with your accessibility advocacy efforts, please let me know! Feel free to message me or set up some time with my office hours [link] if you want to chat.

Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions.”

Even if you don’t struggle with communication, scripts help you limit the amount of energy you must expend to talk about this work, which will save you a lot of time and energy in the long run.

Set boundaries

As soon as you make noise about accessibility, people will come to you directly for help. This might be because your organization doesn’t have an accessibility team, or some teams but not others have an embedded accessibility person (which might be you). And this is why it’s critical to set boundaries.

Setting boundaries requires knowing what your boundaries are in the first place, which is usually the hardest part. We’re not encouraged to set boundaries in workplaces, and we usually only discover them when someone crosses them. If you have a good manager, setting boundaries can be easier. If you don’t have a good

manager or your manager isn’t really involved in what you do, it’s much, much harder.

The specifics of how you set boundaries will depend on you, your role, and your situation. If the idea of setting boundaries is scary, another way to think of boundary setting is teaching people what to expect from you. Ultimately this is helpful for them, because you’ll be training them that if they follow your rules they’re more likely to get what they want.

Here are some ideas for communicating boundaries.

Be able to say what your priorities are at any given time. This makes it so that you’re not pushing back when people want more out of you; it’s just you being honest about what you’re working on.

If you’re not sure how to respond to someone, say you’ll give it some thought and provide an estimate for when you’ll be able to get that information to them. If you answer people immediately it’s extremely hard to train them out of expecting that. And, if you expect yourself to give the correct answer right away all the time, it’s extremely hard to not get frustrated with yourself when you can’t.

Give a turnaround time that’s realistic for your priorities. Things are almost never as urgent as people make them out to be. If someone comes to you with what they think is an accessibility emergency, it’s probably because they weren’t following established practices, or there aren’t established practices to follow. Neither is your fault alone.

If you’re new to something and have no idea how long something will take, propose that you do some investigation into it and that you’ll share an estimate in the next couple of days. Even if you’re very comfortable with a doing a task, padding by 25% more time is usually a safe buffer. c So that thing that you are pretty sure you can start on a Monday and deliver that Friday? Say you need until the following Monday, if not Tuesday. Something will always come up!

Draft a working agreement for engagements with ICs and teams. This is your opportunity to say how you want to interact, how much support you can provide, and what the timeframe is for that support.

Devin Owsley told me about how they use working agreements to set and maintain boundaries when working with teams.

I define urgency with every team that I start with. That's how I introduce myself. “Hey, this is how I define urgency. Not that I'm thinking your work is lower priority, but if you are pinging me on Teams, I mute those channels because I can't handle it with my ADHD. If I see your message and I'm in the middle of something that I need to be working on, depending on how high priority it is, please let me know that you need an immediate response from me, otherwise I'm going to get to your message when I wrap up the thing. I cannot task switch back and forth. I will get nothing done. That's not helpful for anybody if I'm an important part of handoff or designs.”

Working agreements, I think, need to be templatized and shared with every single accessibility person out there,

because that is an easy direct link to getting out of burnout because we are constantly pulled in all directions.

Identifying helpers and adversaries

Any sort of change management work is going to come up against people with different levels of enthusiasm. If you think back to Chapter 4: Organizations, you’ll recall that people come along for change in several phases across a bell curve. Some people are bought-in immediately. Others take time and only join kicking and screaming.

I think it’s important to consider when people come on board. It’s also important to consider what people become in this work. Wherever you are in your work, you will also establish relationships with different people. You are forming a web of connections. Some will want to help you in the day-to-day work, and others will be able to provide support from afar.

I’d like to propose a few categories or roles of what people become in the work to help us think about what they can best do to help.

Comrades

Comrades are your most involved helpers. They have your back and aren’t interested in doing the work performatively. These are the folks you vibe with regarding this work, and who you can be more honest and collaborative with in your communication.

Comrades will most likely be ICs, but they may also be PM/POs or people from internal teams like DEI, knowledge management, or people that work directly with customers. You may find them early in the work (as they appear in the Rainbow of Death as Instigators), or you may find them as you go.

If words like “comrades” make you uncomfortable, I have a couple of thoughts.

One thought is that it’s okay to not be at the forefront of a movement. It’s okay to not rock the boat if doing so makes you unsafe. That said, a lot of the techniques and strategies I talk about in this book are about rocking the boat while appearing that you are keeping the boat absolutely perfect and level in the water with a smile on your face. You can do both things at once with practice.

My second thought is this: I think it is very hard to do accessibility work sustainably without thinking about the revolutionary nature of it. I think it can feel much safer and more comfortable to demand only the bare minimum from our organizations, and that’s dangerous for the very people we’re trying to help. This work requires always pushing against power, even just a little bit at a time. Pushing against power is always uncomfortable, at a bare minimum.

Champions

It’s pretty standard at this point to call a group of pro-accessibility folks a champions network or similar. These are people who aren’t collaborating with you day to day, and don’t necessarily have traditional power in the organization. But they can be extremely

helpful to spread information and awareness throughout the organization climate.

Champions can carry your message to their teams, so they may be your primary connection to some teams and projects. Accessibility is part of their job, but they don’t make it their full time job.

Sponsors

Sponsors are a bit further removed, but they are still supportive. They are most likely very senior ICs, senior PM/POs, and people in formal leadership—that is, people with some level of traditional power in the organization. These are the folks who can sign off on a pilot program or be a backer for a community of practice. They help enable the work but aren’t in it day to day. Your relationship with them is a bit more formal, so communication should reflect that.

People who legitimately care about the product and have the authority to leverage that care can become excellent sponsors even if they aren’t personally invested in accessibility work. If they think of accessibility like security or localization, they’re sponsor material because they understand that there are a lot of moving parts in an initiative or program to change company climate and culture.

Adversaries

EJ Mason summed up adversaries well when we talked. They said:

There's a point when you see resistance to accessibility as an operational goal. What people are doing is choosing

capitalism.

Occasionally you will run into a person who actively works against your efforts. I don’t mean that they drag their feet. I mean they actively push back. They consider accessibility a waste of time and money.

Typically, these are not folks who back any “progressive” workplace efforts—DEI, unions, employee-owned businesses, etc. The common denominator for them is that if things don’t “make money,” they are not worthwhile.

In a best-case scenario, the simplest thing we can do is just not engage with bad actors. If there are power lines that flow around that person instead of through them, those are probably better options for you.

This gets very difficult when that bad actor is your manager, or your director, or your CEO, though. Odds are, if they are truly against what you’re trying to do, they are against similar work that other people are trying to do around equity, belonging, and making the organization more stable and hospitable. There are probably other people they’ve pissed off, and those people might make excellent comrades.

Sometimes it’s only possible to make progress in part of the organization, based on how it’s currently organized and based on how much energy and power you have. And that’s okay.

Figure 22: A diagram of comrades, champions, sponsors, and adversaries. The circles of the first three are touching each other because they are often connected within the organization.

Resistance and communication

Adversaries aside, resistance is not (usually) overtly malicious. You may encounter resistance from anyone in any role, in any part of the organization, at any time. As an accessibility advocate, and especially if you are a disabled person yourself, this can be heartbreaking. Even the most innocuous request or statement you make can make people defensive or upset. The same goes for requests you get. People will be hurtful, accidentally or on purpose.

On a good day, you might laugh it off. On a bad day, it might lead to a meltdown.

There are many reasons for non-malicious resistance. The most common ones I’ve found in this space are burnout, something called institutional non-participation, and ableism.

Burnout

People might be burned out at their regular job, which will impact how much energy they have to engage with you. However, they may also be burned out about previous, failed efforts to push accessibility work or other DEI work. Even for people who aren’t advocating for change directly, there is a kind of fatigue that comes from being told over and over again that things are going to change, when they don’t.

Institutional non-participation

Adjacent to burnout is the concept of institutional non-participation. In Communities of Practice, Etienne Wenger describes institutional non-participation as a way for people to distance themselves from their workplaces and work cultures.

These folks use coping mechanisms to not participate. These coping mechanisms generally fall into three categories: compromise, strategy, and cover, but what they all really mean is some flavor of “I just work here.” 1

Compromise is usually the first step. It’s doing your best to not let work impact you outside of work. Work is simply an exchange of goods and services for money. “I just work here, and work sucks everywhere, and I am just going to get my paycheck and not think too hard about it.”

Strategy is purposeful. It’s knowing that work impacts our identities and using non-participation as a kind of freedom. It’s “I just work here, and work sucks and is ruining my life, but I have vacation starting on Friday so I can stop thinking about it then for a few days.”

And last, cover. Cover is complicity. Cover happens when you really, really don’t like what you do and you need to fully disconnect emotionally to actually do the work. The example that Wenger uses is that of insurance adjusters having to think about the company and not the real people they are impacting. It’s “I just work here, I really need this job, and I’m going to keep my head down and pretend I don’t care and don’t know what’s going on, otherwise I’ll start screaming.” Cover can happen when you feel the most powerless. D

Is identity related to our work under capitalism complicated? Yes. I don’t intend to solve that problem here. But I do think recognizing different facets of non-participation can help us better understand why people might or might not engage with us.

Ableism (and anti-ableism)

Often, resistance to accessibility work comes in the form of internalized ableism. This applies to disabled and non-disabled

people. It’s especially true for accessibility practitioners who aren’t out as disabled and who pass as non-disabled. If you are “invisibly” disabled, you are going to hear some wild shit from your coworkers about disabled people that they expect you to agree with.

Combined with burnout and institutional non-participation, ableism can make people believe that they can’t possibly do anything to fight ableism, so they don’t opt in to collaborate.

And, to make things even more complicated, ableism can also push disabled people into accessibility roles when they don’t want them. Should disabled people drive the conversations we have in the accessibility space? Absolutely. Should disabled people who don’t want to do accessibility work have to? Absolutely not.

One person I interviewed said this about the fine balance of being pigeon-holed in accessibility work just for being disabled and knowledgeable about accessibility:

Sometimes I think people who are disabled or especially people who are blind and low vision, are thought of by so many people as people who can test stuff. My thought is how do we go beyond that and make sure that, while that is great and that should be happening, that's not the only thing people do, and that shouldn't overshadow what people might have done otherwise.

I'm also looking at, for example, roles in the UX research space that might not be accessibility focused. Then what happens with me, I know that I do have accessibility-heavy

profile, but what sometimes happens is the accessibility work overshadows other work that I might have done. Or in other words, the transferrable skills that I've gained doing accessibility research go unnoticed.

At scale in an organization, ableism also impacts any number of decisions and assumptions. It appears as beliefs and practices like:

“Accessibility is only an engineering problem.”

“Accessibility is taken care of because we have an accessibility team or an accessibility specialist.”

“We only need accessibility training for teams that build products and not people that work in support, legal, operations, leadership, or other parts of the organization.”

Accessibility is in competition with security, privacy, localization, or ‘shipping fast.’”

“We ran accessibility tests but we don’t have time to fix anything before launch.”

“I’m okay with accessibility work but it can’t impact schedules and roadmaps that didn’t originally take accessibility work into account.”

“We’ll hire disabled people, but only to do accessibility work.”

“Disabled people don’t work here.”

“We don’t have disabled customers.”

Create opportunities to educate and build trust

As much as ableism creates disillusionment and heartache, we also must be conscientious of barriers to knowledge. We live in an ableist society, so our organizations are ableist by default.

Accessibility has not traditionally been taught in primary, secondary, or higher education. It’s not often taught in any real way in bootcamps, professional development, or other forms of structured education for workers. So, it’s no wonder that we’re not set up for success, and that lack of education about ableism is part of the problem in and of itself.

This is crucial to how we communicate about accessibility efforts with individuals and across organizations, in our services, and in our programs. We must give people grace when they need it but also press when they don’t.

Every communication you have with people in your organization is an opportunity to model anti-ableism. The best way I’ve found to do this is to consider every interaction you have in the workplace as a potential opportunity to do at least one of three things in the service of anti-ableism:

Ĉ. Correct casual ableism and misinformation about disability and accessibility. This chips away at that assumption that there are no disabled people in your organization or among your customers.

ĉ. Act like doing accessibility work is normal. Humans like to belong. If you communicate and work like accessibility work is

normal, that will demonstrate to others that they can do the same thing.

Ċ. Educate people just a tiny bit more about accessibility. You

never know what is going to hook someone and bring them over to your side. Consider your communications, even the asynchronous ones and the informal ones, as opportunities to hold space for people to learn.

Lastly, I want to leave you with something Crystal Preston-Watson pointed out about the importance of keeping our humanity in these conversations:

I use my humor. I’m an absurdist. That’s just how I live my life. That’s my life philosophy. I don’t know if any of this means anything and I’m not going to really worry about it. I’m going to try to do as good as I can while I’m here. I do bring that in all facets of my life. Then one thing I did really notice when it came to accessibility in my work, people get really stiff and like, “Ooh, we’re talking about disability.” There’s no sort of lightness to it. This is impeding, I think, the amount of progress that can be done.

Chapter summary

This chapter was about different types of communication with different audiences. Depending on people’s roles, they will have different expectations about how they receive information and in what format.

Tracking who communicates with you and how is a way to get a better idea of who you can trust as comrades, champions, or sponsors, and who you can’t.

The chapter also talked about ways that people resist communication about accessibility and gave suggestions for making opportunities for people to learn.

Chapter 10: Service activities

Allie Thu: I was a team of one for a little over a year or so, and holy moly, I got to dabble in every possible way across the org, whether it's QA, UX, project management, audit management, every type of thing, working with the highest of highest executives, to just working with the ICs and every type of space within the organization. I wore the hat for all of those things.

What you’ll read: In this chapter, you will learn about different types of accessibility services you might offer your organization. You’ll also learn about the opportunities and challenges of each, and how they might help meet the needs of your organization.

Operations and programming aren’t usually the first step for accessibility work, or any change management work. Usually, someone (you) will start offering support to help colleagues with accessibility work at the grassroots level. You might do something like office hours, or code reviews, or lunch-and-learns. You’re putting out feelers to see what people seem to like.

This will look different depending on how accessibility currently fits into your “actual” job. It usually starts with working at a level beyond what you’re “supposed” to. For example, if you’re an IC, you might start with providing accessibility support across your team, in addition to your regular duties.

If you’re an accessibility specialist embedded in a specific product team, you will probably start supporting people outside your team who work on other products. If you’re on a centralized accessibility team, it’s probably part of trying to move along the slow process of org-wide change.

Often, you do this out of enthusiasm because it seems like a good opportunity. It can also be out of desperation after you’ve become a bottleneck, or are otherwise overwhelmed, and you can’t keep doing the work by yourself. It usually seems like things get out of hand overnight, going from a handful of requests to dozens. You’ve got a lot of good ideas about what needs to happen next, but not enough time or resources to be proactive.

So what can you do after you become The Accessibility Person? How can you get more support? How do you even begin to explain this to anyone who can help you?

Let’s start from the beginning before we even start offering support to others.

What is a service?

A service is an act of help. Any time you offer support, expertise, or guidance, you’re providing a service. Training, mentorship, and accessibility auditing can be types of services, for example.

The details between services will often bleed together, but in general a service is a bucket you can point to and say, “With this

service, I can provide you with this type of help. If you need this different type of help, that’s this other service over here instead.”

Every service is a chance for accessibility education. I don’t say this to alarm you. Instead, I hope you see this for the opportunity that it is: a chance to practice and model anti-ableist, intersectional accessibility work.

Goals of creating services

The primary goal of creating a service is to provide a specific type of help to address a specific need. If you think back to the community readiness model I introduced in Chapter 5: Community, you may recall that it’s important to first find out what your audience’s needs are before you start any initiative. Once you are aware of a need, you can potentially create a service to attempt to address it.

In addition to creating and delivering the service, we need to measure how effective the service is at meeting the need we’ve discovered. Think of providing a service as an experiment. To know what you’ve accomplished, you need to understand the conditions before and after you provide the service for some amount of time. Only then can you argue that your experiment was successful. Then we can leverage those successes to ask for more support to provide more or better services, and so on.

We’ll dig into the specifics of measuring and planning services in later chapters. For now, though, let’s just focus on some of the

services you might offer and consider what types of needs they might meet.

Types of services

There are many, many services you might provide. The ones that we’ll focus on are these:

Audits and assessments Usability testing Mentorship Office hours Reviews Training

For each type of service, we’ll discuss a few things, including:

Purpose: What purpose does the service serve? Opportunities: What are potential benefits or upsides? Challenges: What are potential barriers or downsides?

Take small steps

The exact services you will provide will always vary based on your expertise and interests, as well as on your organization’s climates, culture, and needs. Part of meeting the needs of your organization is meeting your own needs first. This work requires many people with different skills and talents, and you should never feel like you have

to offer a type of service you’re not comfortable providing. Growing in areas you’re not currently strong in is an opportunity to ask for professional development support from your manager.

For example, let’s say that a lead IC on your team is impressed by the accessibility knowledge you’ve demonstrated in team rituals like code reviews and lunch and learns. They ask you to put together a workshop for your whole team to do together. You don’t have any teaching or instructional design experience, so you’re worried that any workshop you do won’t succeed. There are a few things you could do in this case.

If you do want to learn more about running workshops or other training, talk to the lead IC and your manager about how you can grow that skill. There might even be resources within your organization for learning about facilitation, teaching, and instructional design that you can use.

Another option is to collaborate with someone who has the teaching or facilitation skills you don’t. This person might be a training or professional development specialist within your organization. They also might be a friend or colleague whose communication style you admire.

For example, the person you partner with because of their facilitation skills doesn’t need to know anything about accessibility. You’re covering that as the accessibility specialist. This person can instead help you shape the information you want to convey into a suitable workshop.

And yet another option is to wait, until your skillset or interests change. And that’s okay too.

Audits and assessments

Audits and assessments involve doing accessibility testing of features or products that are already built. Audits tend to include taking a broad sample or snapshot across a product to get a sense of its overall accessibility health. Eric Bailey probably describes the experience of doing an audit best in “Accessibility auditing and ego” when he says:

[An accessibility audit] takes a snapshot of a website, app, kiosk, or other digital experience and provides a summary of:

What isn’t working,

How numerous the problems are,

How severe the problems are, and

What can be done about them.

What is done with the audit after that is another thing entirely.

1

Assessments are usually smaller and more ad hoc. They are often limited to a feature or component. This distinction is also kind of arbitrary, and you’ll probably find people using the terms “audit” and “assessment” interchangeably.

Often, an audit or assessment is the first service you’ll be asked to provide, even before you’ve considered that you’re providing

services at all. Since accessibility work is often reactive to a legal issue, usually the first step is to see how bad the problem really is. As a result, people in authority usually default to asking for an audit.

Purpose

Audits and assessments are a good fit if you need to log accessibility issues in an experience. You can count how many issues there are, how severe the issues are, and (when possible) how to fix them. You can then track as issues get closed or fixed, giving you something to measure over time.

Opportunities

Audits and assessments are most useful for setting compliance benchmarks. You can use metrics like number of issues, severity of issues, related WCAG success criteria, and other data to track the potential accessibility health of a product across time. They are also needed to maintain formal records like reports based on a voluntary product accessibility template (VPAT).

Challenges

Audits and assessments generate accessibility issues or tickets, which in theory teams are supposed to fix. However, these issues often go into a backlog and never get addressed. Unless an authority explicitly instructs a team to focus on accessibility work, it’s difficult to integrate into an organization’s day to day work this way.

Audits and assessments also usually take a lot of focused time and energy for the auditor. This is likely your responsibility if you don’t have a relationship with a vendor to do this for you. It will take a big chunk out of your bandwidth, especially if you want to create high quality tickets that clearly describe problems, reproduction steps, recommendations, impact, and so on.

Additionally, if you are disabled, your disability may make it impossible or dangerous for you to test for certain types of issues on your own, meaning you’ll need support from others to get those parts tested.

How difficult and time-consuming audits and assessments are will depend a lot on the product or feature being tested. Remember that audits typically require more formal reporting and documentation so they will take longer, even if the scope is small.

How useful an audit or assessment is often depends on the maturity of the organization and the team. In Chapter 8: A traditional accessibility program case study, I gave you an example of a typical compliance scenario that started with an audit. Here’s another example that’s more progressive.

Let’s say that a team comes to you because they are working on a new feature. They want you to do an assessment of it before they launch it, and their test and release window is coming up soon.

Before you decide to simply do the assessment for them, consider what you already know about this team. For example, maybe you’ve been encountering several members of the team regularly with other

services you provide. How have those interactions gone? How engaged are they? How would you loosely rate the accessibility literacy of those team representatives?

Or is this the first time they’ve reached out to you? Are they expecting you to be the accessibility police, or do they seem open to collaboration? Do they want to learn from the assessment? Do they have wiggle room to make improvements if you find accessibility barriers, or will the issues just go into a backlog? Do they have a track record and a reputation for caring about quality in their work? Are they doing this work in good faith, or because they “have” to?

All of these considerations can help you decide how you want to proceed. Maybe the feature is very straightforward, and you can quickly test it for them. Maybe they’ve already been deeply engaged, and this is just a sign-off on work you know they’ve already done. What you do should depend on your relationship with the team, what you know about how they work, and where an assessment should fit with your other priorities.

The first rule of Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is “don’t use ARIA,” 2 and I think the same is true for audits. Whenever possible, steer people toward a different service offering. Or see if you can hire a reputable vendor to do it if conducting an audit is unavoidable. A vendor may also help to bring legitimacy to the audit since there’s a third party involved (especially needed if there are legal concerns), so it feeds two birds with one scone.

Usability testing

Usability testing is getting feedback on your products from actual users. These might be people who actively use your product, or they might be in the potential audience for your product. In the accessibility space, usability testing should focus on testing with disabled people. This includes people who use assistive technology and people who don’t.

In the old days, usability testing was managed by user researchers and happened in formal lab settings. However, this doesn’t happen much anymore. For one thing, teams are often distributed, hybrid, or remote, reducing office space.

The lab setting typically goes out the window when you invite disabled people to take part anyway. If you do usability testing with disabled users today, it’s probably over Zoom. You probably also have participants using their own device and their regular setup for that device.

You’ll usually run usability sessions on your own, or with a vendor. Ideally, you'll also include colleagues who work in design or development and others who benefit from participatory learning.

Purpose

Usability testing helps you to find out if a product works for humans. It’s the way to go if you need information on how functional and usable a product is, as opposed to how compliant it is.

Opportunities

Because we live in an ableist society, accessibility and disability are very abstract to many people. I’d argue that one of the biggest opportunities for doing usability testing is connecting people who build products with disabled users.

Usability testing is also great for creating content for reports, training materials, and other resources you might share with colleagues. Usability sessions also help support the needs of people who want to engage with a process to learn, or to have specific examples to watch or listen to.

While I don’t usually recommend having usability test participants test things with known blockers, sometimes you can use usability testing to demonstrate the need for accessibility work. Observing an actual human on video experiencing an actual barrier is sometimes what people need for this all to click. This can be extremely helpful for getting buy-in.

The experiences you have testing with users are going to be as varied as products and users themselves. Instead of providing an example of this kind of testing itself, I want to share an example of when this kind of testing truly made a difference.

An example

Around 2015, I (and I think everyone else who worked in accessibility agencies in North America) spent a lot of time working with airline clients. This was because of a looming deadline that they were all scrambling at the last minute to meet before June 30, 2016.

Specifically, the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) updated the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) to include accessibility requirements for airline websites and kiosks. This required airlines to meet WCAG 2.0 level A and AA for critical customer workflows like booking, checking in, and contacting the airline. A At the time, this ruling was kind of groundbreaking in that it required not just testing against WCAG but also usability testing:

Your primary Web site must be tested in consultation with individuals with disabilities or members of disability organization(s) who use or want to use carrier Web sites to research or book air transportation in order to obtain their feedback on the Web site's accessibility and usability… Collectively, such individuals must be able to provide feedback on the usability of the Web site by individuals with visual, auditory, tactile, and cognitive disabilities. Consultation is required to ensure that your Web site is usable by individuals with disabilities. 3

In plainer language? An airline couldn’t just have accessibility “experts” test its website or run an automated tool. Actual disabled humans had to give them feedback on whether their products were actually usable.

I can’t speak to the long term effects of this measure. But in the short term, this forced product teams at airline companies and vendors to engage with disabled people in ways they hadn’t before. At the very least, they were receiving direct feedback from disabled users. And maybe, at least for a while, they were rethinking

accessibility to be about usability and not just compliance with outdated guidelines.

Challenges

There are a few big challenges to providing this service, and of course they are all connected.

In Chapter 1: Burnout, I touched on how user-centered design work isn’t prioritized in many organizations. Many organizations simply don’t do usability testing at all, or do very limited usability testing, because they don’t have the expertise, resources, or interest to do it well. Doing usability testing with disabled users is even harder to do when you don’t have a climate of usability testing already.

Another challenge is convincing people in authority that it’s a good use of time and money. When accessibility budgets are often small to non-existent, authorities think audits look like a much “better” use of resources. If an organization doesn’t have an established usability testing culture, this situation is very difficult. If authorities do approve usability testing for accessibility, it usually happens at the end of the product cycle, functionally replacing auditing. C

Yet another challenge is trying to do usability testing or any other type of accessibility research with disabled people at all. As Dr. Michele A. Williams points out in her article “Conducting Accessibility Research In An Inaccessible Ecosystem,” tools that we use for design and development often aren’t accessible.

Just like websites, web, and mobile applications are similarly inaccessible, including those that produce early-stage prototypes. Thus, the artifacts researchers might want to use for prototype testing to help create accessible products are themselves inaccessible, creating a barrier for disabled research participants. It quickly becomes a vicious cycle that seems hard to break. 4

The same barriers that keep many disabled people out of product teams also keep them from doing testing for product teams. Doing testing often requires workarounds, which can be difficult when organizations don’t have people to spearhead research in the first place.

Mentorship

Mentorship is traditionally a type of teaching role, where the mentor provides a person with encouragement, support, and intervention when necessary. 5 Sometimes it means simply being a sounding board on an idea. Sometimes it means consulting on strategy and the murky stuff that wraps around accessibility work.

Purpose

Mentoring is the answer when an individual wants more support than they’re getting to grow their literacy or expertise in accessibility. It lets you collaborate with that person to co-design an accessibility literacy journey that works for them.

Opportunities

Mentoring is a great way to level up people who are already on the road to high accessibility literacy or expertise. It might include giving feedback on mentees’ work, providing support as they define their own education plan, or just being a friendly ear.

What you do as a mentor will have a lot to do with mentees’ individual learning and communication styles and goals. As such, it’s a huge opportunity to grow champions and comrades in the space in your organization. These people might end up creating and running trainings, writing documentation, facilitating communities of practice, or mentoring others.

Challenges

One-on-one mentoring isn’t for everyone. It requires interpersonal skills and knowledge that not everyone has or wants. Since accessibility is a DEI issue, mentoring can bring a lot of responsibility outside of just accessibility education, too. Mentees might disclose personal information or other concerns about work or home. Put on your own oxygen mask first, and don’t become your coworkers’ therapist!

Mentorship can be intense, so here are some tips.

Limit the number of mentees you take on for a given period of time and plan to cycle them. Give a time frame up front so folks aren’t caught by surprise or can’t meet their goals with you.

Decide with each mentee if you want to meet once a month, once a quarter, or more or less frequently.

Only take on folks who have already gotten over that hurdle of low literacy. Otherwise, you’ll just be teaching material they can learn elsewhere.

Always develop a goal for mentorship, or it can just turn into a monthly venting session. That’s not bad, but not always what’s needed!

Office hours

Office hours are set hours you are available for questions from pretty much anyone. I’ve had the most success making these scheduled meetings with one person or a handful of people. But you can also imitate the real-world equivalent, where literally anyone can show up in the timeframe in your “office.” These are regularly scheduled so people can expect to know when the next timeslots are available.

Purpose

Office hours help to address just-in-time questions about work that people are currently doing. These questions should be specific enough that they can be at least addressed in the timeframe allotted.

When you’re first starting out, keep notes on what types of questions you’re able to address in the timeslots you use for office hours.

Once you see a pattern, you can include examples in meeting invites or forms where people sign up for office hour slots. This will give folks an idea of what you can handle in this timeframe and setting.

Opportunities

Office hours are an excellent way to get a peek into what teams are actually doing. You’ll often get access to mockups, annotations, preproduction code, and other things that aren’t finished. This gives you the opportunity to help people make improvements before the end of their work cycle.

Office hours are also a great way to do some informal research on how your other services are going. Often people will come to office hours because they don’t understand something from training and their question wasn’t answered there. The same goes for documentation.

Sometimes people do show up without having checked those other sources though. It can feel inefficient, and it’s easy to get irritated. But remember that some people learn best by listening in conversation or by doing something hands-on. The best documentation in the world won’t work for them, and that’s okay.

It’s also a good idea to follow up with people who attend your office hours. This lets you see if the session had a positive outcome on their work. You can do this informally with a direct message in your organization’s messaging app or put together a short survey. You

can also follow up with a meeting summary so they can look back to see exactly what you covered together.

Challenges

Sometimes people come to office hours way too late in their process, or they will bring you a problem that is too big for the time slot. Sometimes they are looking for an assessment in real time. Office hours should not be one-on-one training sessions or “audit hours.”

No matter what office hours bring on any given day, they will always entail task switching, which can be a problem for your other work. Carefully timebox office hours so that you can decompress before returning to other services or projects.

If what a person is asking of you will take longer than the session, be honest about that, and make a plan to follow up. You can make yourself scripts for these scenarios too, so you that you give everyone the same information and opportunity.

Reviews

If you’re an embedded accessibility specialist, this is probably part of your job.

Design, prototype, and code reviews are another window into understanding how people are doing work. You can also use these reviews to get a sense of the priorities and rhythms of a team.

Sometimes teams have formal review sessions that you can attend. If you have a champion or comrade on a given team, that can give you the opportunity to reach out for an invite.

Whereas office hours are always live, reviews can be asynchronous. This can give you more time to understand and digest the information you have before providing a response.

Purpose

Reviews are a great way to find gaps or problems with how teams are documenting and discussing accessibility work. Reviews help address issues that are captured in design files, prototypes, and code, before the new or updated feature is pushed to production. This can help teams prevent accessibility bugs in products in the first place.

Opportunities

Reviews give you the opportunity to create regular check-ins with teams during their regular work cycles. If you do recurring reviews, you can readily see patterns in understanding and behavior. This gives you the opportunity to provide timely feedback that teams can use for their next round of product work.

You can also combine reviews with other offerings, like office hours or assessments. This gives you different chances to see a team’s work through different lenses.

Challenges

One downside to reviews is that teams can become dependent on you to find accessibility issues for them. This can set the expectation that it’s your responsibility alone to catch any accessibility issues before launch, even if this isn’t formally part of your job, or you are doing reviews for a team that’s not yours.

Ideally, doing a review is set up with the expectation that this is a temporary service. The idea is that the team will take over their own accessibility responsibilities over time. It’s a lot easier to set that expectation if you do it up front when you’re talking about participating in a review in the first place.

For example, you might offer to do a set number of reviews, where you focus on different types of issues each time you support a team. You can also ensure that they know how to find any relevant videos, documentation, or other resources you have between sessions. This can sometimes help people answer their own question.

Training

The difference between training and other forms of education is that training is formalized and standardized by some authority. That authority might be you, or an instructional design specialist, a subject matter expert, or someone else with a vested interest in people learning.

Training materials usually live in a learning management system (LMS), knowledge management system (KMS), and/or are delivered in live or recorded instruction. Training also brings with it the idea

that everyone in a certain audience receives the same education. The goal isn’t to teach everyone everything they need to know to do their job. The goal here is to create a foundation that you can build upon later with other services.

An example of training is the type of information you might receive during onboarding at a new job. Another example is a workshop that a whole team, division, or job role attends.

Purpose

Training helps the underlying need for any organization to grow its accessibility maturity, which is to get everyone on the same page regarding accessibility. It’s typically the pathway for efforts to “normalize” accessibility, that is, make it just like any other part of an organization’s processes and workflows.

Opportunities

Standardized training is your opportunity to get the same information in front of many people at once. Training lets you impact what many people think and do about accessibility.

For a one-person or small-team accessibility program, it’s your best chance to reach people at all places in their accessibility literacy journey. As is traditional in our space, you can create training for specific disciplines or roles, like engineers, designers, and so on. You can also create training that is for different groups, like product teams, customer support teams, and HR. The benefit of teaching by discipline is that you can go deeper on topics. The benefit of

teaching by team is that you can show team members that they all have a role to play, and that accessibility work can fit into their processes and workflows.

Training is also a great opportunity to collaborate with learning and knowledge management teams, if you have those in your organization. Slotting training into platforms and services that are already in use for education means you don’t have to be responsible for managing materials unless you want to update them. This is also a great opportunity to teach learning and knowledge management specialists about accessibility so they can help to make other people’s content more accessible too.

Challenges

Training takes a long time to develop, especially at scale. Bigger, broader audiences like whole organizations require broader, more basic information.

You have to assume that the accessibility literacy of the audience will be very variable, and you have to assume that people do a wide variety of things for work. Smaller, more specific audiences like teams require more targeted information that addresses how they work together on projects. And individuals in specific roles need even more targeted information for their day-to-day work.

Developing training often feels like an exercise in saying very little to a lot of people or saying too much to a few people. It can also be challenging to address different learning styles in very standardized training. Striking the right balance takes patience and practice.

The best way to address this in my experience is to give people different options for exploring each topic you want to cover. You might present the same information in a few different ways, such as:

Written content

A video

Discussion questions they can consider with a colleague who’s also taking the training

An activity or exercise to practice what they’ve learned

Links to other resources to learn more

A cart before a horse

When accessibility training is introduced into an organization, it’s usually targeted at product teams, and it’s usually divided up by role. Sometimes teams will receive education as a group, but that requires customization and, more importantly, it requires time that people who manage those teams usually say they don’t have.

I think this is a mistake. Instead, I think it’s more realistic to create organization-wide training first, followed by team-specific training and discipline-specific training. To use a building metaphor, this raises the foundation before you try to construct the floors of the first and second stories.

This is what I recommend.

Organization-wide training should happen first and introduce the absolute basics. This is your chance to work with your DEI team (if

you’ve got one) and provide training for literally everyone in your organization, that centers the anti-ableist mindset we’ve talked about.

This training doesn’t even have to be about digital accessibility. It’s just about seeing disabled people as normal and hooking into your organization’s mission and values. A good benchmark for organization-wide training is, “What does Louise in payroll need to know about disability and anti-ableism?”

What follows then should be training aimed at teams to focus on how accessibility and disability impact those teams’ goals. For example, this is the introduction to digital accessibility and standards for digital product teams. This training will also talk about process and workflow, as well as being a great space to do some experiments with tools too. For this level, our level-setting question is, “What does Nick the product owner need to know about digital accessibility?”

Finally you can do training for roles, focusing on individual responsibilities and knowledge. Having laid the groundwork for the basics (both anti-ableism and digital accessibility), you can quickly go deeper on role-specific information. This is the level we often start teaching at, and it’s our baseline for ICs. We can ask, “What does Jung-Sook the UX writer need to know about digital accessibility?”

An example

To illustrate this, let’s go back to an example from Chapter 2: Education and literacy. We had a scenario where you needed to figure out how to train a product team. So let’s say that you’ve already laid the groundwork of organization-wide training and teamwide training. However, this team is struggling with what to actually do.

We can use our SMART acronym here. This points to a need for training that is more specific and relevant to the team’s work. You want to help them get started by collaborating to create achievable goals with measurable benchmarks so they know they’ve made progress. And you need to do it in a way that is timebound and doesn’t feel like it’s wasting their time.

Since the team has already gotten team-level training about tools and resources, they may not need new material! They might need you to go through what training they’ve already done and give it more context in a more customized way. By meeting with them, you can get a sense of where they are and see if they need more support at the team level, or if they are ready to dive into more rolespecific training. Basically, you are trying to onboard them to your program and seeing what will work best for them.

To respect their time, you could set up a short workshop every 2–4 weeks. “Workshop” usually conjures the idea of half-day or full-day classes, but adult brains (especially adult brains taxed with all the things we’re taxed with) struggle with that type of setting. One option would be to do a “lunch-and-learn” style session. You can keep it light and short, no more than 30 or 45 minutes. (If the team is

spread out over time zones, you might need to schedule and run each session more than once, and that’s okay.)

To help make the work achievable and measurable, you can say that the goal of the sessions is to come up with a customized plan for getting them up and running with accessibility tooling that’s available to them.

To keep things specific and relevant, you can start the first session by having them tell you more about their process and what they’re currently working on. You may already have this information, but having them tell you about it in their own words will demonstrate that you’re listening, which will make it easier to get their buy-in. Then, you can go over the tools and resources available in your organization. Answer their questions about those tools and resources. Ask about what tools they already use, and what they like about them.

From there, you can get a picture of what accessibility tools might be most helpful for them. Based on what they’re currently working on, you can decide together what tooling is most critical. And you can set a goal together of trying a new tool every sprint, or every two sprints, or whatever fits their rhythms. Using any tooling and using it well is better than none! And if they have a good experience with this onboarding process, perhaps you can replicate this with other teams.

Protecting your energy

Any time you offer a service, there will be pressure to provide more and more. Sometimes this will be obvious to you, such as a person asking for one-on-one help after they see you give one-on-one help to someone else. It also might be less obvious, like more teams wanting to “onboard” to your “program” that doesn’t exist yet. This can still slowly chip away at your energy, boundaries, and interest. Here are some warning signs to look out for, and some example scripts for communicating your way around them.

Task switching

Block out your calendar however possible to avoid task switching, especially if you are doing accessibility work on top of your “real” job. Whenever possible, find out when someone expects a response when they come to you with a request in the first place. You can do this by leading with when you think you can get it to them. Here are a couple of examples:

“Hi, Christine! Thanks so much for reaching out. I’ve had a chance to go over your request. I’m booked out today, so would it work for me to take a closer look and get you some feedback tomorrow afternoon?”

“Hi, Muhammad! Thanks so much for reaching out. I’m working on some high priority tasks this week for the Billing team. If your question isn’t urgent, would it work for me to get you a response on Monday?”

Overpromising and overdelivering

Sometimes it’s really difficult to deliver within the scope you originally set for a service. You might do extra work because it’s something you find interesting, the cause is important to you, or you’re returning a favor. Keep that extra work in your back pocket for later.

If you’ve already overdelivered, be honest about it with yourself and the person you overdelivered to so that you can set better expectations in the future. Be open and honest when anything you’re working on is an experiment, and when something is outside the realm of your expertise. Don’t be afraid to refer people to others! Identifying needs and goals for each service will help you keep within scope, too. Here's an example:

“Hi Jorge! Thanks so much for your question. This is a new service I’m providing, so I’m still experimenting with scope and deliverables. Instead of doing a code review of specific fixes, what do you think about meeting up with the design system team to get their feedback on what components might work best?”

One-off projects

This can be tricky because, at first, everything is kind of a one-off project. But, once you get a sense of how you want to work and what workflows help you, your idea of what is “normal” for you will crystallize.

That said, sometimes it will be very difficult to refuse a special or one-off project once you get into a rhythm of service. Consider the

benefit to your practice if you do the project. Could it provide you with an interesting case study that helps your agenda? Consider how much effort it will likely take. Would it take time away from other services you’re trying to provide? Here's an example:

“Hi Aaliyah! Thanks so much for your patience. Unfortunately, I can’t commit to another assessment of this feature right now. Our original plan was for me to do a review, and then support your team in office hours with any questions they have. Here’s a link to office hours sign-up in case that got lost in the shuffle. Also, if the team wants to do their own assessment, there’s a guide available in the Accessibility Handbook in the wiki, too!”

A mini case study of a one-off project

Members of a product team once asked me to do a custom training for their team. They had individually learned from me through materials I’d put up on our internal wiki, office hours, and our community of practice. Some had also come from organizations with more mature accessibility programming.

To put it simply, I did not have time to create a custom training for their team. However, the team was doing high profile work. They were overhauling their product, so it was the perfect time to educate the team and demonstrate the importance of such to other teams. I knew I needed to be involved, but I had to figure out how to do it with the lightest lift possible on my part.

I proposed that instead of me coming in to teach their team, what if they did the teaching themselves, with my support? I pointed out all the examples that demonstrated that they knew more about accessibility than they perhaps realized, things like research they’d done with disabled users, assistive technology testing they’d completed (and well!) on the previous version of the product, and so on.

I felt comfortable proposing this based on the trust I’d developed with these individuals. I knew what they’d already accomplished because I was connected to them through the services I was providing and the community of practice I was co-managing.

We agreed to set up two presentation sessions for their team, led by themselves and other members of the team that had more accessibility literacy. Each session would include two short talks and Q&A for the presenters. This would be a much easier pitch to the product manager than a traditional half-day or full-day workshop or class would be.

In the next weeks, I met with them periodically to help outline their talks, answer tricky accessibility questions that arose, and practice their presentations. I functioned as a coach and mentor, and occasional subject matter expert.

The team got more and more excited about the presentations as time went on. We even decided as a group that while their team would be expressly invited, everyone from across the organization was welcome to attend. We advertised it through internal newsletters, discussion channels, and our community of practice.

The talks themselves went off without a hitch. I got so many congratulatory messages from across the organization, and I had the pleasure of redirecting those messages to the folks who actually did the hard work! But I also realized that I’d laid the groundwork for them to feel confident enough in their own accessibility literacy and knowledge that they could do the work themselves. The good will, trust, and interest we collectively created was a huge selling point for other teams.

Chapter summary

This chapter discussed different services that accessibility practitioners often provide, including audits and assessments, usability testing, mentorship, office hours, reviews, and training. Each of them has challenges and opportunities that depend on the organization and where it is in its accessibility journey. The chapter also gave advice about things to avoid when you are providing services, such as overpromising or overcommitting.

Chapter 11: Overview of a program

Eric Bailey: One of the things I have observed is that in doing this work, there’s a lot of glue work that comes out. And so a lot of the time, the things that I actually do day-to-day are traditionally done by project managers. But since accessibility is such a new practice in the industry at this level and scope and scale, there is no playbook for it. We are building this plane as we fly it.

What you’ll read: In this chapter, you’ll learn what a program is and the reasons to use a program management model for accessibility work.

“Devon,” you are thinking. “You spent a whole chapter (Chapter 7: Accessibility operations, to be specific) telling me that operations is a better model than traditional program management for accessibility. Why are you telling me about programs now?”

In short, operations breaks some of the rules of program management, or at least puts a different spin on them. A traditional program often comes down to doing things for other people. Operations is about enabling other people to do those things largely themselves. To understand what rules to break and when with

operations, you need to understand what those rules are doing for a program in the first place.

When I spoke with practitioners about their practices, one of the themes was how accessibility practitioners often work between other individuals or teams. We often find ourselves bridging between teams, or at least trying to, rather than just bridging between individuals, resources, and information.

Traditionally, that type of work is done through a project or program, so let’s start there.

What’s a program?

A program is a collection of activities organized around a goal or need. Programs do three main things:

Ĉ. Take investments of resources and information

ĉ. Bring people together to do activities

Ċ. Capture and measure data about those activities

If you don’t like words like “investments” and “resources,” you can think of a program as a set of interrelated experiments. You make a hypothesis, conduct experiments, and then see if the results match your hypothesis. A

The person who coordinates a program is usually a program manager. The program manager usually works with other people who take on other roles, like project managers, team leads, and ICs.

If the program is larger, it might also have product owners and people who manage ICs by discipline, like a design manager or an engineering manager.

But programs are where things get messy in the accessibility field. In a normal program, the program manager may do extra tasks occasionally. But they usually aren’t also running all the activities, analyzing all the data, and being a subject matter specialist, all the time.

People expect accessibility practitioners to be subject matter experts, legal experts, designers, engineers, researchers, educators, and program managers, among other things. It’s a pattern that’s familiar to overachievers. You do so well at something that you get a reward, and that reward is more work. If you make enough noise about accessibility, you are rewarded with doing accessibility. All of it. Congratulations?

People outside our field almost never understand this, so let’s describe what an accessibility program usually is.

What’s an accessibility program?

An accessibility program is usually one or more people working to help an organization do ongoing accessibility work.

It might be an official program, where someone has “program manager” in their title. It also might be completely ad hoc, with people who have no formal or informal training in either accessibility or program management. It might form in reaction to

an event like a lawsuit. Or it might be more proactive. Or both at once.

These programs do many things, based on what’s possible in their organization. Common activities are:

Advocacy and getting buy-in Tool management Vendor management Process and workflow management Instructional design and training Knowledge management Content design or UX writing UX design Development or engineering Quality assurance (QA) Embedded subject matter expertise for product teams Strategy Reporting and compliance Team management User research Employee resource group (ERG) leadership

In large organizations with long histories of legal compliance around accessibility, accessibility programs might be very well established. There may be a centralized program connected to accessibility teams for different divisions or connected to embedded practitioners in different product teams. In an organization that doesn’t have that type of history or established structure, there might not be a program at all.

You might be trying to start that program. You might be the program already.

Why build an accessibility program

There are many reasons to start or grow an accessibility program. The main reason is because every organization already needs one. Every organization already has disabled people working there, and every organization makes products or services that disabled people use. Our society and therefore our organizations are ableist by default. We need accessibility programs to counter that.'

This might seem overwhelming for very good reason. In fact, you might be telling yourself that it would be easier and better to just keep doing what you’re doing rather than trying to start a program. Let me try to convince you otherwise.

In, Chapter 4: Organizations, you learned about things that shape organizations: power, culture, and climate. A program is an accepted way to make major, formal change in an organization, especially a corporation. On paper, a program plays nice with the power

structure of the organization. Programs are safe, trusted vehicles for meeting needs of an organization.

Accessibility thinking, meanwhile, can be a catalyst for true change. Anti-ableist work is inherently threatening to the status quo, so it’s no surprise that organizations built on the status quo resist them. Building an accessibility program can be like a Trojan horse, where you put a threatening thing (anti-ableism) inside a safe, trusted thing (a program) and wheel it into your office.

On its face, you’re just normalizing accessibility, like programs for security, localization, social responsibility, and workplace safety. In practice, you have the opportunity to do a lot more.

When to consider building a program

You may have been told by someone in management or leadership that you “have” to build a program, or the nicer version, you have an “opportunity” to build a program. In which case: Sorry, and congratulations!

If you are already providing two or more accessibility activities or services, you are already, technically running a program, by definition. Sorry, and congratulations!

If you aren’t already running a program, a good time to start one is when you feel like you have grassroots support. That is, when the organization climate is pro-accessibility. Ideally the organization culture isn’t actively hostile to accessibility, but you can do this work in any case.

Here are some examples of having grassroots support:

You have a lively and engaged community of practice around accessibility

You have a culture that supports knowledge management

People are demanding more accessibility tools, supports, and education, especially ICs who came from other organizations with more mature accessibility programs

Your organization has a strong, supported DEI program

Your organization has active ERGs for people with marginalized identities

You’ve had positive reception to any accessibility efforts, however small or informal, you’ve tried so far C

If you’re worried about your bias and you aren’t sure if grassroots support is there, one of your first activities should be to learn about people’s attitudes about accessibility, which we’ll talk more about in Chapter 13: Organizational needs.

Where should accessibility programming be situated in an organization?

I think there are as many “right” and “wrong” answers to this question as there are organizations. As I mentioned in Chapter 7: Accessibility operations, accessibility work is hard to find a home for. In some organizations, accessibility practitioners report up to legal, for example.

There are a lot of arguments for fitting accessibility programming into DEI. And I do think that accessibility is and should be part of any organization’s DEI efforts, since those support marginalized workers in the organization. However, accessibility also must be part of the organization’s products and services. It’s necessary to have anti-ableism and accessibility as part of how the organization makes its products and considers its customers.

Ultimately, the day-to-day work of making accessible products and services must be decentralized and within the power of individuals. It doesn’t matter where the formal program lives as long as it is supporting ICs and tapped into the power lines of the organization. And it’s another good argument for accessibility work to take an operations approach, where a team can live outside of other teams or divisions and focus on relationships with those groups.

The program lifecycle

At the beginning of this chapter, I told you that programs have three parts: investments of resources, people brought together to do activities, and a way to capture and measure data about those activities. The formal way to talk about this is with program inputs, outputs and outcomes. 1

Inputs are resources and information Outputs are the activities we do with those inputs

Outcomes are the information we get from those activities

Drawn out, this creates what’s called a logic model, where each thing flows into the next.

Figure 23: A simple logic model.

Inputs

The inputs are our collection of available resources and information. They might be:

The resources of people, such as their time and expertise

Organizational resources, such as systems, processes, architectures, or money

Needs of the organization Goals for our program

Outputs

The outputs are the activities or tactics we create to meet the organization’s needs and our program’s goals and strategy. These are not just the things we produce, but also the community that forms by peoples’ participation in our program. They might be:

Services like the ones we talked about in Chapter 10: Service activities

Products such as documentation, guidelines, or handbooks

Opportunities for participation, such as in a community of practice

Outcomes

The outcomes are what actually happens. We use that data to see how reality compares with the needs, goals, and expectations we started with. In business-speak, outcomes tell us whether we “hit our OKRs and KPIs.” c These outcomes can be used to make decisions about what can or should be done next. They are made up of:

Results of outputs

Impacts of those results

Next steps

The information we get at this stage can be fed back into our logic model loop the next time we need to make decisions. This way, we are constantly refining and using our information to make better and better decisions. We’ll talk more about this in the next chapter, and we’ll continue to explore these different stages of programs for the rest of this book.

Figure 24: A slightly more complex logic model showing the major features of each part.

What you can’t control

It is not your responsibility alone to ensure accessible products and services, even if you are a formal program manager in charge of the accessibility programming for an entire organization. The systems that make you feel that way do so by design, and it's not your fault.

No matter what your current role is and no matter what you try to do as you create a program, a lot of things will be out of your direct control. You can potentially influence them, but they ultimately rely on other people, as well as your organization’s culture and priorities.

These things will vary based on your situation because they are impacted by power, culture, and priorities within your organization. When I even mention things that are out of your control at work, you can probably come up with a very long list of things that have come up just this week, and some of them probably don’t even have anything to do with building an accessibility program.

It’s very important to be very firm in your understanding of what is out of your control, and that yes, this will have impacts on your program. Otherwise, you’re liable to blame yourself for failures that are the result of systemic issues and not your own decisions.

What you can control

It’s important to do a few things for your own mental health as well as the health of your program as you start out. These are all things we’ll explore in the following chapters.

Start small

Don’t take on everything at once, especially if you have never run a program before. Your program cannot and will not be perfect to start. Actually, it will never be perfect, because nothing is. If someone else has decided the scope of your program for you, sorry, that’s awful. All you can do is pace yourself and do what you think is best with the information you have.

Make decisions with data

When I say data, I don’t mean just the general statistics on disability we throw around. I mean the information you collect on the needs and sentiments in your organization about accessibility work. It takes practice, but you can save yourself a lot of grief (literally!) by basing your decisions on data instead of your feelings about the data.

Don’t tie your personal worth to success

Just because you believe something is morally right or good doesn’t mean it will automatically succeed. As a result, even your best work might not produce the outcomes you want. You can design the “perfect” program for your organization and shifting priorities or changes in leadership will undo your work. If that happens, you can make the informed decision to try again, or to leave and try somewhere else, provided you have the privilege and resources to do so.

Chapter summary

This chapter provided an overview of what an accessibility program usually looks like. It introduced the logic model for programs, which includes inputs (resources and information), outputs (services, products, and community activities), and outcomes (ways to evaluate your success). This model emphasizes managing what you can control and worrying less about what you can’t control.

Chapter 12: Information and resources

Uncertainty can be caused by a lack of ability to find needed information or being overwhelmed by the quantity of information.

– Carol Collier Kuhlthau in Seeking Meaning

What you’ll read: In this chapter, you will learn about leveraging the information and resource you have available to you.

In the last chapter, we learned that programs start with inputs. There are two main kinds of inputs.

One is information, which is pretty intangible. This is a combination of your collected wisdom, what you know about your organization, its priorities and goals, its workflows, and its people.

The second type of input is resources, which are (usually) more tangible. Traditionally these are things like budget and headcount. Resources also might include time, buy-in from colleagues and leaders, offers of labor and support from comrades, champions, and sponsors, or any other kinds of social capital at your disposal. A

No matter how thorough you are, you will never have perfect information, and that’s okay. You can always take the information

you have, make decisions with it, and then revisit and reevaluate what you decided as needed. In fact, the logic model we talked about in the last chapter tells us that this is what we’re supposed to do.

So, let’s talk about these inputs and how we can use them.

Deciding what’s data

All information is a kind of data, and the most important thing data can do is to help you make decisions. In organization theory vocabulary, using data to make decisions is called data-driven decision-making (sometimes abbreviated to DDDM).

This isn’t just weird business-speak! This term helps us divide what is data our feelings about that data.

For example, as humans we make a lot of decisions based on our “gut,” which is kind of a mix of our intuition and our lived experience. There is nothing at all wrong with making decisions based on your gut. In fact, using your gut is usually a critical way to keep yourself safe in dangerous circumstances. I would argue that what your gut is telling you is absolutely information, but it’s not necessarily information that other people will think is sufficient.

For example, if you’re standing up to a senior leader in a corporation, that certainly feels dangerous, and our instinct can be to rely on intuition, compassion, or empathy. However, this type of scenario can be the worst possible situation in which to base your arguments on intuition or your feelings.

Addressing a power imbalance

In Chapter 6: Intersectionality and disability, I mentioned that I think the accessibility field shares the DEI field’s struggles around measurable success. This lack of measurable success makes it harder to get backing from leadership for formal accessibility programs. I think there are a few reasons this happens.

We often start accessibility work from a place of legal panic. As a result, the emphasis of our work is on testing and applying band aids to accessibility barriers created in the past. This kind of work does produce measurable data, but it’s usually limited to things like the number of issues opened and closed during an audit. This usually isn’t enough to communicate impact of ongoing efforts to leadership.

The people doing accessibility work are mostly ICs, not program managers or operations specialists. 1 They don’t necessarily have program management or operations skills, since that’s not part of their “real” job. They’re often doing accessibility work on top of their mandated work, with means it’s not part of a regular workflow. It happens when it happens, or people work too many hours to get it done.

In that scenario, setting and measuring goals is usually the last thing people are thinking about. They’re thinking about fixing products right now so that people can use them, because they believe accessibility is important, not because they have a sustainable plan to do accessibility work.

A third factor has to do with trust. A lot of people don’t trust the leadership at their organizations. 2 There is a huge power imbalance between company leaders and normal workers, which includes ICs and often PM/POs, where leaders often get rewarded even if workers get laid off or lose important benefits. 3 There is potentially a lot of risk in approaching a leader, even one you like, and telling them that the organization needs to address a systemic barrier. If you don’t like or trust a leader, doing that advocacy can feel fruitless.

Combined, I think these factors make it very difficult for the people who usually do accessibility work to advocate for lasting change around accessibility at their organizations. We’re set up to address the immediate symptoms of accessibility barriers without the tools or resources we need to address the root cause. We often don’t have the emotional resilience or the skills to try to play the long game in our advocacy, because we’ve already burned out trying to do the work in the first place.

Using data to punch up

Doing this work for the long term requires advocating for organization-wide change. Doing accessibility programming as an anti-ableist practice means punching up. That often means having to counter authorities’ gut feelings and decision-making. When people say things like “disabled people don’t use our product” they are almost certainly doing this without any data, but from their gut. When they say, “accessibility is expensive,” they are probably repeating something they heard someone else say, or they have lived experience with an accessibility program that didn’t perform

the way they wanted. Or they’re simply ableist. That’s always possible!

So why should we lean into data? To make program-level decisions based on data is a way to take yourself and your feelings out of the equation. There is less room for argument if you have data to demonstrate why you made a certain decision or a certain recommendation.

People whose gut goes against your advice or who simply don’t like the decision will have less room to say that your decision was illogical or “woke” or, if you are a disabled accessibility practitioner, that your efforts are selfish.

If you present these people with data, they may still say no! But you will at least have a record of exactly what hard information they said no to, and all the evidence that supports it. You can take that evidence to the next person in power who can possibly help you, or strategize with your comrades to socialize the information differently with your network of champions. And that time you failed to get buy-in becomes nothing but another data point in your collection, no more, no less.

Collecting and analyzing data

So, what type of data is useful for accessibility operations work? Let’s go through the different types of data and data collection we’ve already talked about to get a picture of the information we might

have at our disposal, as well as other sources we might be able to use.

Communication tracking

In Chapter 9: Communication and coalition, we talked about keeping track of requests you get and communications you send out. This may be an important source of learning about what resources are at your disposal. You also may get hints about what teams or divisions are doing based on the questions you get, or when those questions are asked.

Your communications tracking is a cross-section of your view into the organization’s current climate and culture around accessibility. Because of this broad perspective, it’s extremely possible that you might be the only person in the entire organization who knows that a certain situation is happening. This might be important information for your decision-making, or the decisions of others.

For example, you might look at your logs and realize that two separate teams are trying to solve the same problem. Or you may discover that you have been helping two different members of the same team who came to you independently and don’t seem to be talking with each other. You might be able to research these efforts and others on your organization’s internal wiki or intranet to get more context. Then, you can share what you figured out, and potentially help those different teams or people work together.

Mass communications and meetings

I am the first person to admit that I cannot pay attention to allhands meetings, “town hall” meetings, and internal conference events. Even if the tools for accessing them are fully accessible to me, anything that people deliver in that kind of format immediately slides off my brain. Unfortunately for me and others like me, these types of communications are an important source of information about what is happening in an organization and how people feel (or at least how they say they feel) about it.

Company-wide meetings, emails, and other mass communications can be a source of information on organization-wide initiatives, trends, and deadlines. They’re also a way to learn about high profile projects that have leaderships’ attention. These are all things that may have an impact on any type of programming you want to do.

For example, you may encounter pushback for a large program because it’s viewed as conflicting with other DEI programming that’s going on during the same time. C You might find out that an important product is going to ship by a date that conflicts with a major training you’re planning, so the folks who should attend wouldn’t be able to. Or you might find out that a new community of practice is starting, say, a community for front-end focused developers, or people that work in internal support. All these things are landmarks on the landscape of the organization, which you can use to better understand what goes on and why.

While you might not like mass communications and meetings, they are a standard way that information gets shared around an

organization. Studying them and identifying ways you can slip your message into them can be very effective in the long term.

At the beginning, you will almost certainly chase these efforts instead of getting ahead of them or participating in them. But you can at least pay attention to the signs around you to know what the organization is focusing on at any given time.

Susan Bustetter gave an example of leveraging mass communications that’s helped her accessibility practice.

Every week, we have a division-wide—so 150, 180 peoplemeeting. One of the agenda items every week was a security tip because of some random survey that we have to take every year.

I asked, "Can we do an accessibility tip once a month?”

Now, we have a safety, security, accessibility, and technical tip for the four weeks. I get to do an accessibility tip once a month. [This is normalizing accessibility], bringing it into everyone's vocabulary, teaching our division staff, which although is not the whole state, is 180 people.

Past successes

When an initiative or program is successful, sometimes you can simply replicate it and adapt it to your own needs. You probably won’t have all the exact same pieces in place, but it’s a template of success you can begin with. Learning about the processes those

initiatives went through can give you ideas for what might work for you.

You may be able to learn about these efforts by searching your organization’s wiki for pages or documents with words like “initiative” and “proposal.” You can often find out about past successes by talking to people who were around in the organization when the initiative or program was new.

Looking at these successful initiatives can also be a way to see what gaps you have in your strategy or scope. For example, you might look at a successful initiative to build out product localization and find out it relied heavily on sponsorship by a particular member of senior leadership, or it was tied to a specific policy or legal change. Or you might learn that a certain initiative had a formal charter, committee, or community of practice in place before it was accepted as something the organization should take on.

These are signs that you might want to try the same tactics. If the people who led those initiatives are still around, you can ask them about how they did the work. They might be potential sponsors, too.

Communities of practice

Communities of practice, which we talked about in Chapter 5: Community, are a great source of quantitative data.

Through a community of practice, you can track things like:

The number of members over time

The roles, job levels, and teams of people in the group

Sign-ups and attendees for events

All these data points can show how much a wide variety of people get out of engaging with you and each other through the community. You can use these numbers in conjunction with other data sources to show leadership the breadth of impact of your work.

Communities of practice are also a fantastic source of qualitative data. Here’s an example.

While co-running one community of practice around accessibility, I ran a virtual session to learn more about where different teams were in their accessibility journeys. About 50 attendees went into small groups where no more than two people were from the same team. They were asked to talk about what was going well in their accessibility work, and what wasn’t. After about 10-15 minutes, the groups reported back on what they discussed. Between all the teams, I ended up with qualitative data points I could grew in a few categories.

Here are examples of things that were going well:

Folks in the community are considering accessibility in their work day-to-day

Community offers a chance for people to level up their knowledge and literacy

Folks in the community are identifying gaps in their teams’ processes and knowledge

Collaboration between teammates in the community

And what wasn’t going well:

Some people assume the design system is perfectly accessible so they don’t have to do anything Some people need help discovering internal tools and resources The fast pace of work is a barrier because accessibility is not considered part of the minimum viable product (MVP) ICs are missing the nuance of how people actually use assistive tech People are doing a lot of stopping and starting around accessibility work; it doesn’t feel natural Work feels reactive, not proactive There are misconceptions from leadership about how accessibility work gets done It’s “everybody’s” job, so it’s “nobody’s” job Accessibility of internal tools and resources isn’t clear

The group also felt comfortable coming up with and sharing other things they wanted the community to explore:

Executive sponsorship of the community Formally assigning responsibilities of product accessibility to roles for accountability

Accessibility of physical spaces where the company’s product is used

All in all, this only took about 30–40 minutes out of everyone’s day, and I was able to get a lot of rich information. I took notes about who was in each group so I’d have a frame of reference for which teams were experiencing which issues. I also made notes about related topics that came up, such as areas of the product that people felt needed more accessibility attention, or opinions on which roles should own what parts of our processes and workflows.

All of this was information I was able to use to make better decisions about the services I was providing at the time, and to plan new services and projects.

Accessibility literacy assessments or surveys

In Chapter 3: Accessibility literacy, I provided an example model for assessing accessibility literacy in a more formal, qualitative way with the Accessibility Literacy Framework (ALF).

Collecting multiple literacy assessments across teams and roles, and over time, will help you track the learning of people you work with. This will give you rich, qualitative information about changes undergone by individuals. You can use this information to demonstrate the impact of your programming over time.

If the accessibility literacy method doesn’t work for you, you can always create a simple survey. A great time to collect survey data is before and after a training, program, or project. If the results are the

same before and after, you’ll know that your work didn’t have the impact you wanted. If the results improve afterward, that’s evidence that your work contributed to that improvement.

You can ask scale-based questions specific to those activities and see very quickly how people’s attitudes and knowledge have changed (or not) from working with you. I recommend scale-based questions because you’ll always get more information than you would from simple yes/no questions, and they still require relatively little effort from participants. 4 They also open the door to asking more detailed, open-ended questions that can teach you more about participants’ beliefs and motives.

When possible, use existing tools and methods for your organization for these surveys. For example, maybe your organization has a quarterly survey for employees, for example, or a weekly prompt in a discussion channel.

Also consider when it’s perfectly fine to have anonymous data, and when being able to tie data to specific people is needed. I tend to err on the side of anonymous surveys because it protects participants and it allows people respond more freely. If I need to get deeper answers, I like to give folks the option to opt in to be interviewed on the record, off the record, or anonymously. Accessibility work brings up a lot of personal feelings, which people don’t always anticipate until they’re in the middle of an interview with you. It’s always okay for participants to want to protect themselves with anonymity or to request that you only use their feedback as background for your study instead of quoting them.

For studying accessibility literacy I recommend starting with ICs. Once you feel confident in your data for ICs, you can work up to PM/POs, and so on.

Even though PM/POs aren’t usually hands on with products, they are critical to this work. They can be your best helpers in directing ICs to get the skills and resources they need. For that audience, you want to shift the language to their knowledge of the people who report to them. Here are some example survey questions for ICs and PM/POs.

For ICs

On a scale from 1 to 5 for each question, where 1 is the least and 5 is the most:

How comfortable are you with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (or other relevant guidelines)?

How comfortable are you with using internal accessibility resources on your own?

How comfortable are you with testing with assistive technology?

How well do you understand how people with disabilities use assistive technology?

How well does your team handle accessibility during handoff between roles?

For PM/POs

On a scale from 1 to 5 for each question, where 1 is never and 5 is very frequently:

How frequently do ICs who report to you mention accessibility in discussions about growing their role or responsibilities?

How frequently does your team document accessibility as part of product requirements?

How well does your team handle accessibility in your documentation and processes?

Community readiness surveys

While I was estimating a maturity model score and thinking about literacy for the case study in Chapter 8: A traditional accessibility program case study, I couldn’t avoid thinking about what I would have done differently if I was doing that project now instead of during the early 2010s.

The remediation-focused way I did the work then was the norm at the time, even for organizations that didn’t have active lawsuits against them. It’s possible that any efforts to focus on usability over compliance would have been rejected since the organization was doing the work because of a legal issue.

If I was in this magical re-do scenario now, I would want to start with talking to people to get a more holistic sense of where the organization was with accessibility. Ideally, I would have interviewed people in different parts of the organization and come up with a

community readiness assessment to help guide remediation and training activities instead of just jumping in where I was told. c

The areas I would want to research from a community perspective would generally be culture, climate, and knowledge. You can and should always add or adjust questions to fit your needs.

Culture

In your opinion, using a scale from 1 to 5, how much of a priority is accessibility to the organization, with 1 being not at all and 5 being a high priority? Please explain your rating.

In your opinion, using a scale from 1 to 5, how much of a priority is accessibility to senior leadership of the organization, with 1 being not at all and 5 being a high priority? Please explain your rating.

Can you describe what accessibility efforts or initiatives there are currently at the organization level?

Climate

Would team or organization leadership support expanding accessibility efforts? Why or why not?

Describe your organization’s values.

What does your community/discipline/team/organization think about accessibility?

On your team, are there people who actively share resources or lead discussion about accessibility?

Are people expected to do accessibility work as part of their job, or is it viewed as extra or additional work? Why?

Knowledge

In your opinion, using a scale from 1 to 5, how knowledgeable do you think people are about accessibility, with 1 being not at all and 5 being very knowledgeable? Please explain your rating.

What kinds of information about accessibility do people have at their disposal?

How do people access this information?

How does the organization measure the accessibility of its products and services?

Scoring In this scenario, my accessibility readiness scores might look something like this.

Table 10: Accessibility readiness scoring example

Area Culture

Readiness level Level 2 (Denial/Resistance)

Reason Accessibility is not a concern of leadership, and there is no immediate motivation or resourcing to do anything.

Climate

Knowledge

Level 3 (Vague

awareness)

Level 4

(Preplanning)

Organization climate as a whole is neutral, disinterested, or believes that this issue does not affect the community.

UX designers and front-end engineering have a relatively high level of knowledge and literacy and are beginning to make their own plans around accessibility.

Accessibility maturity assessments

If you or someone else has done an accessibility maturity assessment before, you can use them as a jumping off point. If you don’t have access to a maturity assessment and you’re expected to deliver a formal report to leadership about the state of accessibility work, consider doing one. That said, there are pros and cons to doing a full maturity assessment on its own.

Accessibility maturity assessments are a bit like voluntary product accessibility templates (VPATs). They capture a moment in time, and if you have the right context, they can be helpful for understanding where an organization is with its accessibility journey. D However, putting one together takes a lot of effort and, in my opinion, the result is too brittle to be useful day to day. VPATs, for example, don’t

capture the nuance of using a product that does or doesn’t meet “compliance.” And accessibility maturity assessments don’t capture the blood, sweat, and tears of accessibility work in an organization.

But I do think the accessibility maturity model is an important tool to help us discuss how building accessible products can’t be disentangled from having an accessible workplace with accessible hiring. Like a community readiness survey, an accessibility maturity assessment is just a framework you can use if it works for you. You can pick and choose the parts that are most relevant to your organization and make changes over time as you learn more about what works and what doesn’t.

Gathering resources

The best chance of creating lasting change in any organization requires working in community with people who manage information, standards, data, and climate. That way, even if individual people leave or get laid off, you’ll still have your knowledge of the organization to hook back into, and your awareness of how to learn about the ways the

organization is changing. Having that context is critical for success.

In fact, if you have a budget and headcount around accessibility work, those things still don’t guarantee success. In fact, having them may create a false sense of accomplishment with leadership. “Oh, don’t worry,” they will say. “We have people handling that.” E

Internal resources

This is where power lines come in clutch. In addition to your knowledge of the culture and climate of an organization, your knowledge of how power works and resources flow is critical.

The specific internal resources you need to align with will be completely different in every organization. In general, you will want to foster collaboration and mutual aid with these types of groups. Even if these resources aren’t official, people doing the work are still exceptional allies.

Knowledge management

Resources like manuals, handbooks, guidebooks, and wikis in organizations are forms of knowledge management. Even if your organization doesn’t have a formal knowledge management team, there are likely people who are doing this type of work. Anyone contributing to documentation about how things work or how things are supposed to work is doing knowledge management.

Knowledge management is a great opportunity to invest in information about one of the anti-ableist pillars introduced in Chapter 7: Accessibility operations, equity and coalition. Investigate who is doing that work and see how you can collaborate. Perhaps you can add accessibility content to existing role-specific handbooks or create a centralized resource for accessibility services, all using tools that people are already familiar with.

DEI and ERGs

I think it’s imperative that anyone doing accessibility work connects with and works in solidarity with colleagues who do DEI work or participate in ERGs for marginalized employees. This collaboration is needed because being anti-ableist requires creating community with oppressed people and other systems of oppression.

Working together also helps to address the numbers game. People in authority who don’t care about disabled people aren’t really going to care if disabled people make up 10%, 20%, or 40% of their user base. By having conversations across DEI and ERG communities, you will quickly find affinities to rally around across groups. This can be a rich source of collaborative events and initiatives. It’s also a way to stretch measly budgets and limited time.

And sometimes the best thing you can do with these various groups is to hold space for each other in community. This means centering someone else and their experiences when they need a safe environment. This isn’t something we get to do a lot in the workplace, so this is an important opportunity to lift each other up and find ways you can move together in mutual aid.

Training and education

Sometimes an organization will have a team dedicated to training or professional development. If you have this type of team at your disposal, leverage them as much as you can.

If your organization doesn’t have a team who manages this, there are still likely standard tools or platforms for learning and onboarding. Putting your training materials in existing tools and onboarding processes is just another way to normalize and streamline accessibility education.

Or, if you can’t use these tools or processes because they aren’t accessible, that’s a jumping off point for framing why your training is important. Part of your work should then be exploring accessible alternatives.

Design systems

Design systems are often a result of hard-fought efforts to formalize and standardize design choices and code bases. People that work on design systems, either formally or informally, are another community of people to align with. These folks are often stewards of their craft or have some other type of power in IC communities.

Making accessibility improvements to the design system can be a great incentive for people to use it. If your organization has a strong climate around using a design system, component library, or other standard, see what you can do to include accessibility in its design, development, and documentation.

The tricky part is reinforcing that the design system isn’t a silver bullet. You’ll need to remind folks of that any time you mention the design system in your documentation and communications. Set clear expectations about how an accessible design system isn’t a panacea, but one piece of a healthy accessibility climate.

Data management

If your organization collects data from employees or customers, you can leverage this type of information in two ways. You can use the data you have about populations to inform your priorities. You can also contribute to data collection efforts to get data about disability and accessibility.

If your organization has a data science team, see how you can collaborate with them. F Just like UX researchers, data scientists can be incredible allies.

For example, if you can get one or two questions about disability or assistive tech use into a customer survey, you now have a source of information about this population. This is data you can use, but it’s also data that enriches the information that everyone doing research in the organization can benefit from. Leveraging these larger surveys also means you’re not responsible for storing that sensitive data yourself. You can leave that up to the data pros.

Support roles

The other major consideration for internal resources is support roles. Always think about how you can spread the load of the work with colleagues who you trust. Here are a few questions you can ask to consider what roles you might want to fill, and who might fill them:

What talents and expertise can help you most for a given project?

What formal roles for projects and initiatives do you need to fill? For example, organizations sometimes require a triad of ICs, such as an engineer, a designer, and a researcher, for a formal project.

Who is suited to be a comrade?

Who is suited to support you as a champion?

Who is suited to support you as a sponsor?

What connections do these people have to power lines within the organization?

At the risk of repeating myself, whenever possible, collaborate. There will always be stakeholders who just want to be informed of what’s going on, and that’s fine, but in the day to day it’s simply much easier to do this work with many hands. If that sounds daunting, don’t think about it as getting people to do work for you.

The work isn’t just for you, after all. It’s for this project of antiableism we’ve undertaken together. Take some comfort in knowing that your role as facilitator/program lead/whatever is just that, a role, which you can swap for another to do the best work if that’s what needs to happen.

Chapter summary

This chapter talked about how to gather information that you can use to direct your program. It also talked about the importance of using information (data) to guide your program, instead of relying on your own emotional labor. It covered collecting and analyzing data introduced earlier in the book, such as communication logs, internal resources, surveys, and maturity assessments.

Chapter footnotes

A. I want to be really clear that I’m not calling people resources!

This has always bothered me as a concept. What I mean instead is that the things people can offer you are resources: their time, expertise, effort, allyship, and so on. There isn’t a way to do this work on your own, so practice being comfortable accepting help! [Return to text]

B. I was once told that an accessibility push wasn’t going to be realistic because people in the organization were suffering from “DEI fatigue” at the time, so, yeah, don’t be surprised if you’re in “competition” with other DEI efforts. [Return to text]

Chapter 13: Organizational needs

Interviewee: [They] hired me on as a UX QA. That doesn't really exist. It was weird. Their UX team and their engineering team weren't really meshing well. I came in and I was like, "I don't understand, can't you all talk to each other?" I don't understand what the problem is. It's like, this is not a role that really needs to exist. This is a fault in whatever process that you've put together.

What you’ll read: In this chapter, you’ll learn about using the information you’ve collected to identify the needs of your organization. You’ll also learn about tactics to prioritize those needs.

Identifying needs

Now that I’ve gone on at length about the wealth of information and resources available to you, let’s focus on using those inputs to identify specific organizational needs.

Asking how, what, and who

A lot of questions around accessibility work start with how, what, and who questions. After all, you need these types of questions to frame

specific recommendations or solutions. For example:

What are our organization’s accessibility goals?

How will we improve our processes to include accessibility?

How will we get senior leadership to care about accessibility?

What should we manage internally, versus what should we do with a vendor?

Who is responsible for accessibility quality assurance on a product team?

You can go from a how, what, and who question in a relatively straight line to a goal, along with any evidence you have that supports the recommendation you’re making. Pretty standard stuff. But, when we start with these questions, we actually skip a step that can give us a lot of context.

Asking why

I once had the pleasure of attending a workshop put on by a design equity consultancy. Most of the attendees were UX designers and content writers I worked with at the time. The purpose of the workshop was to help us integrate principles of co-design with marginalized communities (primarily BIPOC communities, but others too) into UX practices.

One of the most impactful things I learned in that workshop was the importance of asking why before asking how. Why questions can give us insight into deeper problems that need to be addressed first.

Why questions

“Why” questions are often easy to answer but difficult or uncomfortable to address. Their purpose is to dig below the surface and identify motives, societal norms, and other factors that have important and often-unseen impacts on how we make decisions. The workshop facilitators recommended going five layers deep with your “why” questions when possible, to really identify root problems or areas of uncertainty.

The good news is that if we’re already thinking in how, what, and who questions, we can turn them into why questions pretty easily. The questions I asked at the beginning of this section can turn into these:

Why should we decide our organization’s accessibility goals? Why should we improve our processes to include accessibility?

Why should we get senior leadership to care about accessibility?

Why should we do some work internally versus do some with a vendor?

Why should someone be responsible for accessibility quality assurance on a product team?

Once we start asking “why” questions, we can begin to excavate underlying assumptions and motives. These assumptions might be ours, they might belong to the organization, or they might be from the larger culture.

You can use why questions to get an idea if your how question is taking you in a productive direction. If you hit a why question that you can’t answer, or the answer feels ambiguous, that’s a good place to do some information gathering.

Why questions can be challenging to hear. When you’re asking why questions, be considerate of who you’re asking, when, and where. Sometimes it’s safest and easiest to just ask them for yourself.

Here are some examples.

Example 1: Getting senior leadership buy-in

Ĉ. Why do we need to get senior leadership to care about accessibility? Because permission to do work comes from them.

ĉ. Why? Because they set company goals and priorities.

Ċ. Why? Because they have to serve shareholders.

ċ. Why? Because there needs to be profit.

Č. Why? Capitalism.

Example 2: Improving processes

Ĉ. Why do we need to improve our processes to include accessibility thinking and doing? Because we don’t have any process steps that focus on accessibility.

ĉ. Why? Because accessibility hasn’t been a priority for teams.

Ċ. Why? Because product owners think it will slow teams down.

ċ. Why? Because they think accessibility is slow and expensive.

Č. Why? I don’t know. (Hold that thought!)

Example 3: Doing accessibility work solo in an organization

Ĉ. Why don't we have a formal accessibility program? Because I’m the only accessibility practitioner in the organization and we don’t have a good model for working with teams.

ĉ. Why? Because accessibility hasn’t been an organization priority.

Ċ. Why? Because leadership hasn’t prioritized it.

ċ. Why? Because it doesn’t fit with their ideal user or customer.

Č. Why? Because their ideal user or customer isn't disabled.

Answering a why, gently Here’s another example in context. Say you aren’t sure why product owners (POs) seem opposed to accessibility work, you can spend some time learning why as part of your data collection.

Why do they believe that accessibility work isn’t worth the effort? Is it because previous efforts to integrate accessibility in the product failed? If so, why did they fail? Is it because they are experiencing pressure from senior leadership to ship quickly? If so, was there an explicit discussion about accessibility, or did they feel it was implied?

This is a case where it helps to have some comrades or champions on the product teams in question. If you already have those connections, you might be able to find out from them how POs’ attitudes affect day to day work. POs have busy schedules, so the easiest way to talk to them directly might be via chat, or via office hours if they have them. Use your resources to identify the communication method with the least friction.

And, always remember that your organization has access to any DMs you send on company tech, so don’t say or ask anything over DM that you wouldn’t want to come to light!

Prioritizing needs to meet

Once you start digging, I have no doubt you will find many places in the organization that can benefit from your time and attention. It is usually not difficult to find accessibility gaps. In fact, what is difficult is prioritizing them! Here are some techniques to help narrow your focus and determine your priorities.

Using urgency versus importance

As a person who will gather and organize information just for the enjoyment of it, deciding what to act on and when has often been a challenge for me. The primary tool I’ve used lately to take large bites out of prioritization is the Eisenhower matrix. 1

The Eisenhower matrix is a tool for distinguishing between things that are urgent versus things that are important (yes, those are

different things). It uses a quadrant system to help you map out requests, tasks, or decisions. You can then prioritize based on the results.

I’ve made some tweaks to better align the matrix with the realities of our field.

Figure 25: An Eisenhower matrix.

Here is now the grid breaks down:

Ĉ. Do tasks that are both important and urgent. These are tasks that should be core to your work.

ĉ. Schedule tasks that are important and not urgent. These are also tasks that should be core to your work, but they can get done later.

Ċ. Delegate or timebox tasks that are urgent but not

important. These are often things like sending updates, replying to messages, and other administrative tasks that can randomize us.

ċ. Deprioritize tasks that are not urgent and not important.

People are always going to ask you to do things that you simply don’t have time to do, and that’s okay. You are only one person.

Now, your idea of what is urgent and important might be very different from your colleagues’ and leaders’. Your priorities should always be geared toward what is best for your wellbeing as a person first, an accessibility practitioner second, and your organization third. If that means prioritizing something that has a smaller impact but should have a better chance of success, do that. Those successes, even small ones, stack up!

If you don’t have anyone to delegate to, that’s potentially a great conversation to have with your manager. They might be able to take those tasks off your plate or recommend someone in your team or an adjacent team who has time. If delegation isn’t possible, timebox part of your schedule each week to chip away at those tasks. Even just 30 minutes of dedicated time per week can make a huge difference.

Here is an example Eisenhower matrix using a sample of the items that were on my to-do list at one point. At the time, I had these tasks and others in a giant checklist, which was overwhelming. It just kept getting longer, and I was too brain-fogged to organize it better.

Figure 26: An Eisenhower matrix with some of my work from late 2021.

Here are those tasks with some reasons why I put them where I did.

Do: Important and urgent

Most tasks in this category were critical for moving the whole accessibility program forward, which would have a big impact on the company and our customers.

Q1 plans

This task involved planning activities and goals for the accessibility program for the coming year.

Why was it important? This would impact at least the next year of programming. A lot of other tasks hinged on this one as a result.

Why was it urgent? Since we were already in the fourth quarter of the year, I was supposed to be doing planning for the first quarter of the next. Not doing this would block the program from progressing.

Executive sponsor discussion

This task came out of the community of practice discussion I mentioned in Chapter 12: Information and resources.

Why was it important? I knew that bringing on a sponsor could have extremely positive long-term consequences for not just the community but the accessibility program. I felt that getting someone from leadership on board with our program would help get us access to more resources. This in turn would help accessibility efforts overall, which would have a wide impact on the organization and our customers.

Why was it urgent? Having a sponsor going into Q1 of the next year would be a big help. That level of support would make getting resources easier.

ERG accommodation support requests

I was helping a few people in our disability ERG to communicate with HR around accommodations they needed.

Why was it important? I was an interim co-lead for our ERG at the time, and my experience with doing advocacy in the organization was one of the reasons I accepted the role. Because of that visibility and my experience getting my own accommodations, this was the sort of task I took on.

Why was it urgent? Folks were struggling to do their work and struggling to get accommodations. They were worried about losing their jobs near the holidays.

Prioritize: Important and not urgent

Tasks in this category were important and should get planned, but they didn’t have to happen right now.

Manager training

I was starting to get questions from people managers about how they could support the people who reported to them to do accessibility work better, which was honestly heartwarming.

Why was it important? I recognized the importance of getting buyin from people managers. I felt this was the next step to expanding our formal training beyond what we had for ICs.

Why was it not urgent? The fact that this training didn’t exist wasn’t blocking anyone from doing their jobs. I was already doing Q1 planning and getting people in training at the end of the year is always tricky. This would likely be a task I’d start during Q1, so it could be part of my plan.

Resource guide for DevOps

I was technically in the UX part of the organization, and I didn’t have a counterpart on the engineering side. But I was talking to high-level ICs and others in that area. A need we identified was a one-stop shop for engineers to learn about what accessibility tooling we had available.

Why was it important? This seems like an important step to improve the accessibility literacy of engineers in the organization. They had access to the tools, but the web app the company used to organize all the tooling didn’t make it easy to find and compare accessibility tools.

Why was it not urgent? Like the manager training, this wasn’t blocking people from using the tools. And, also like the training, this was something I could explore more as a project in the new year.

Tool pilot

This was a pilot for a particular accessibility testing tool that would hopefully help address concerns about process and workflow. I was working with some front-end engineers to test it out with their teams.

Why was it important? It was important to help the engineers with this particular type of testing, which they found cumbersome. If the tool was helpful in the pilot, I could make the case that we should use resources to get it.

Why was it not urgent? Engineers weren’t blocked from doing testing. They just didn’t find it easy. (Also it technically wasn’t my job to manage tooling for engineering, but doing it was good for relationship-building.)

Catch up with instructional design

The instructional design team had made some changes to their tools and resources. I needed to set aside time to catch up with them to decide what types of changes we could or should make to accessibility training.

Why was it important? In this case, we were dealing with training that many people got during onboarding or did on their own time. If there were new options or tools, it would help me accommodate more learning styles. And if there were changes in internal instruction guidelines, I wanted to make sure I was following those too.

Why was it not urgent? The instructional design team understood that changes in training at this scale rolled out slowly. There wasn’t anything in the onboarding training that was so specific that there should be wrong information. This was more a matter of improving the quality of the training.

Delegate or timebox: Urgent and not important

Wiki updates

In comparison to all the important tasks, this was not at all mission critical but it related to resources that got a lot of use. These types of updates included things like community of practice session recordings (with transcripts), internal accessibility standards, and self-serve guides for all roles.

Why was it not important? While I worried about this task, everyone I talked to told me it was not a priority. I listened to them. Also, this was usually something I could delegate to someone (often a community member) who offered to take a task off my plate.

Why was it urgent? I liked to keep our part of the wiki, the Accessibility Handbook, as up to date as I could. Sometimes people were hoping to attend community sessions but couldn’t, and I knew people used the topics we discussed there to make decisions on their teams. Sometimes we’d get a new tool or there would be a new update to an internal resource we wanted to highlight. I knew people were reading it.

Deprioritize: Not important and not urgent

This last category is all nice-to-have tasks. I didn’t want them to fall off my radar all together, but if they did, it wasn’t going to be a big deal.

Accessibility “good reads”

A few senior ICs asked about a list of accessibility books I personally recommended, or having a book club as part of the community of practice. Great idea! But in comparison to what else I had on my plate, this was only going to happen once I had two brain cells to rub together to do it. In the meantime, I asked the community to share resources they liked in our discussion channel.

Podcast recording

This was a podcast I’d been invited to take part in with some leaders in our UX organization. It was flattering, but none of us had the time because everyone was doing Q1 planning. Others couldn’t prioritize it, so it didn’t make sense for me to do so.

Catch up on messages

You will never get “caught up” on all your messages. That is just a fact of life.

Leveraging your narrowest constraint

If you are reading this book, I’ll bet that you are struggling with at least one major constraint on your accessibility efforts. It might be time. It might be buy-in. Sometimes you might have a project that

really makes sense to do and should be a high priority, but it has one particular blocker or adversary so you can’t do anything but spin your wheels on it.

It’s very easy to get discouraged when this happens, and to blame yourself for not being good at your job. That’s not true, you’re great at your job.

Accessibility work might not happen because of a change in a team’s priorities, or because you lose a stakeholder because they go to another job. It might happen because there was a gap in your knowledge, because information is never perfect.

Remember that you are only one person and can only do so much, and you can only work within the confines of your narrowest constraint. This is always the case, but sometimes it’s helpful to remember this in the context of planning.

So when you encounter a constraint, take some time to consider your options. Some ways to keep making progress include:

Prioritizing expanding your information and resources. Sometimes the best thing you can do is listen awhile and get better data.

Prioritizing work that helps the biggest audience. Even if a change is small, if it impacts a lot of people, it’s helping. And that includes things that help you help more people! Focusing on literacy will free up your time, for example.

Prioritizing work that helps the most at-risk audience. Even if a change is small, if it impacts people who are usually excluded, it’s helping. These types of changes build equity and inclusion by strengthening bonds between people already in the community, as well as inviting new people in.

Leaning into things that are going well. Remember that not everyone will think this work is critical, and there is value in maintaining and strengthening bonds with existing helpers. Building on success, however small, is always an option. Continuing to refine processes and workflows that are already working is always a good use of time, since it frees everyone up to focus more on the relationships that are the foundation of this work.

When all else fails, consider what part of the organization or marginalized group you can impact the most right now. That might be based on your energy level today, your successes, or your long-term plans. It might be based on a pillar of anti-ableism you pick at random for the day. Whatever reduces harm and fits within your constraints right now is the right decision.

Chapter summary

This chapter talked about ways you can use the information you have to learn about what your organization needs. It explored how, what, who, and why questions you can ask to find deeper motives and meanings. It also introduced techniques you can use to prioritize needs, such as urgency versus importance and identifying your narrowest constraint.

Chapter 14: Setting and operationalizing goals

We just need to disassemble big challenges into clear and simple problems that can be readily measured and readily solved.

– Lily Zheng in DEI Deconstructed

What you’ll read: In this chapter, you will consider how to make realistic goals for your program, measure your outcomes, and make a feedback system for improvement.

In Chapter 6: Intersectionality and disability, I mentioned a systems thinking idea that says “The Purpose of a System Is What It Does,” or POSIWID. Donella H. Meadows expands on this idea in a book called Thinking in Systems:

[One] of the most powerful ways to influence the behavior of a system is through its purpose or goal. That’s because the goal is the direction-setter of the system, the definer of discrepancies that require action, the indicator of compliance, failure, or success toward which balancing feedback loops work. If the goal is defined badly, if it doesn’t measure what it’s supposed to measure, if it doesn’t reflect the real welfare of the system, then the system can’t possibly produce a desirable

result. Systems, like the three wishes in the traditional fairy tale, have a terrible tendency to produce exactly and only what you ask them to produce. Be careful what you ask them to produce. 1

All of this is to say: think about what outcomes you might want to measure when you set your goals. Your program is not your goals or your outputs. Your goals and outcomes are simply the parts of your system that you can put down on paper to demonstrate value.

Goals are a linchpin

Before we figure out what services, products, and communitybuilding activities we want to do, we have to decide our goals. Even with all the data we have at our disposal, coming up with goals can be really difficult. It can feel like trying to see into the future, or trying to guess what people are going to want from you while you’re making this up as you go along. It’s stressful.

I’ve used the metaphor of an experiment a few times in this book. In an ideal world, we could treat our programs like lab experiments. We would spend a lot of time planning, do some work, spend a lot of time analyzing what we did and how it went, and then repeat. This is the type of linear model you see in disciplines like service design, where the primary goal of the process is to decide how the service will work. It gets trickier, however, after the service exists and you have to actually run it and evaluate it!

In real life, we often don’t have that luxury when we are designing services. This is especially the case when we’re laying track in front of the train as we go, like many accessibility practitioners are. But to get folks to buy in, we still need clear goals that align with our organizations’ goals.

And, technically, goals are part of our program inputs. They are one of the pieces of information we use to make decisions about our program and design our outputs: our services, products, and the ways we’ll ask people to participate as community members.

All of this becomes a much larger feedback system after we run it once. All of our outcomes can feed back into the inputs for our next project or program. We’re supposed to learn from each iteration, not get it perfect the first time!

Figure 27: The logic model from before, with a feedback loop added.

A good goal is hard to find

Setting good goals is hard, but I think there are a few ways to think about goals to make them less daunting.

Goals as check-ins in time

One way is to think about goals is to consider how far out your goal is. I got into the habit of doing this after working in libraries and social services, where you often have to justify to someone (a stakeholder or funder) that the work you are doing is worthwhile and efficient in the short term, medium term, and long term. If you can position your goal in time, sometimes that can help you define it more clearly. We’ll talk more about these later in this chapter. A

If you can get data that’s useful in all three of these time frames, you know you’ve got a good feedback loop going.

Goals as constraints

In the last chapter we talked about using constraints to help us prioritize. One way to think of a goal is as another constraint. Once you have picked a goal, it can be a helpful tool to keep you focused.

On the other hand, bad or poorly considered goals can actually be a barrier to getting good work done. They can cause stress, and make you do things that aren’t really in service of the program but are in service of the goal. If you pick a goal that ends up not working out, that isn’t a complete failure. It’s information to make a different choice next time.

Goals as needs

Another way to think about goals is like another type of need. In some situations, goals and needs do line up nicely together, like in

the scenario I shared in Chapter 8: A traditional accessibility program case study. In that situation, the need was to make the main products as accessible as possible by a deadline. The goal was the same.

This may also be the case if you’re given what feels like an arbitrary goal by someone in leadership. What’s the need? To meet the goal. What’s the goal? To meet the need. If you’re doing something under duress or on a short timeline, making it that simple can be a good way to keep yourself on track.

It’s also very possible that someone might hold you to a goal that is realistically not attainable. Sometimes you can’t hit goals because the need outweighs the resources you have. This isn’t your fault. It’s a fault of organizations systemically not prioritizing and appropriately resourcing accessibility work.

Goals and outcomes as two sides of the same coin

Another way to think about goals is to consider what outcomes you want, and to work backwards from there to see what you can do in your power to meet those outcomes. This approach might assume you have the luxury of being able to plan ahead, but I think it’s more aligned with trying things, making mistakes, and getting better. You know, real life.

Like I said at the beginning of this chapter, goalsetting functionally requires looking into the future to imagine what the outcomes of your program will be. This is why it’s extremely important to be

conservative about your goals until you have some practice setting and meeting goals.

Remember that at this point in the process we’ve already narrowed down the needs of the organization and identified your biggest constraints. Use those identified needs and priorities to guide this work instead of spiraling on all the things you “could” be doing. You don’t need to second guess yourself. By planning what you’re doing and establishing why, you’ve already done the questioning.

Start with a goal you know you can meet. It doesn’t even have to be a big goal. Honestly, start with a goal that you feel is frankly unimpressive. If you’re struggling to keep things simple, talk to someone, either someone within your organization or in your “real” life, who has your back and who gets you. Tell them about your proposed goal. I bet they will recommend you be even more conservative with your goalsetting. And do this well before you advertise this goal to anyone who will hold you to it, including your manager.

You are the best person to gauge what is realistic, reasonable, and valuable for you to do. In practicing the act of setting a goal, doing something to meet the goal, reflecting on whether you met the goal or not, then moving forward with the new information you have, you’ll create a viable feedback system. You can then use this system to grow and shift your program as you need to address unforeseen roadblocks and new challenges.

Different size goals require different spans of time

Short term

Collect data you need day to day to do your job in the short-term from the services you’re providing. This data should be useful for you. It may also be useful to report to your manager if the data indicates that what you’re doing isn’t working, or you’ve hit some kind of immovable blocker. Communication logs, event attendance and feedback, and other information you can get quickly is great to set and measure short-term goals.

Here are some examples of short-term goals:

Decrease the number of randomizing questions you get week to week

Increase the number of attendees at monthly community of practice sessions

Maintain engagement with project sponsors from sprint to sprint

Medium term

Medium-term data helps you plan for your next batch of work within your practice. These are also things that are helpful for you to report to your manager, as well as things you

might bubble up to other managers and leaders.

These are the types of data points you can use to demonstrate the value you’re bringing as an individual, too. This might be quarterly, or twice a year, depending on how your organization communicates outcomes. This is primarily about the effectiveness of your program, versus the overall growth of the organization. Community surveys and hard data that shows improvements over a length of time are a great source of data for these types of goals.

Here are some examples of medium-term goals:

Decrease the number of critical severity accessibility issues filed over the course of a year

Raise accessibility literacy for people who engage with your services over the course of half a year

Increase engagement with accessibility documentation quarter to quarter

Long term

Long-term data points are primarily for benchmarking large milestones. This is the level where things like maturity model analysis happen. How has the organization improved (or regressed) over the last year in its accessibility journey? You may not be at a point to do long-term data collection or analysis yet. If your organization has a very low maturity level, it’s probably a better use of your time to focus on smaller wins that you can represent in short-term and medium-term data.

Here are some examples of long-term goals:

Raise the organization’s accessibility maturity

Reach 100% engagement with accessibility tooling

Increase hiring of disabled employees in non-accessibility roles

Another long-term goal to consider is coordinating your system with others. In Thinking in Systems, Meadows wrote:

Harmonization of goals in a system is not always possible, but it’s an option worth looking for. It can be found only by letting go of more narrow goals and considering the long-term welfare of the entire system. 2

This can be a way to get your message out to a wider audience, and to strengthen it by aligning it with similar efforts. Programs and systems that focus on equity across the organization can be a good candidate for this.

You may also find you have common goals with internal teams like knowledge management, human resources, customer support, or others that deal in quality of life for employees and customers. Aligning your goals with theirs (that is, working in solidarity) is a way to combine your resources and expertise to impact a large population over time. It’s also a way to build and strengthen community ties by supporting each other.

KPIs and OKRs

We can’t talk about goal-setting without talking about KPIs and OKRs. Anytime you get into goals in a professional workplace,

there’s a high chance that people will start using these terms. 3 If you’re not familiar with them, it can make goal-setting even more nerve-wracking. But they’re simply this:

Objectives and key results (OKRs) are goals. These are the outcomes you’re trying to create.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are evidence. They’re

measures of success that you’ve met your goals.

OKRs and KPIs are usually used to measure if you’re meeting the requirements of your job, or if your team is the meeting the requirements of the organization. You’ll usually set both OKRs and KPIs with your manager or team lead. And, it’s important that you have both if that’s the system your organization is using. It doesn’t help you to set OKRs (goals) without knowing how you’re going to be evaluated. Everyone needs to agree on what KPIs (evidence) will show you’ve met your goals. Depending on your organization, there are probably specific OKRs and KPIs for your role that you need to meet to get promoted. You often won’t have a lot of control over these, but you can get creative with how you meet them. For example, to get to a senior position, a lot of IC roles require evidence that you’ve led an initiative or process for your team, or you’ve collaborated with members of another team. Those are the types of things you’re doing as an accessibility advocate in your IC role by default! So, depending on your organization, you might be expected to use this language. Don’t let it throw you, since it’s just the same things we’ve been talking about but in business-speak.

What comes after

Sometimes when you look at your outcomes, you will find that your goal was too narrow or too broad. This isn’t bad or good; it’s just more information for you to consider. As you refine your skills in this area, you’ll get closer to your target each time.

There are basically four things you can do after you run a project or program and evaluate it. You can pivot, spin down, expand, or maintain what you’re doing. This can be helpful to remember when you feel constrained for options.

Pivoting

Maybe your experiment didn’t work exactly as planned and it wasn't as successful as you hoped it would be! It’s not a personal failure, it’s a data point. Maybe, based on your information, you’ll learn what circumstances would make your project more successful. Or maybe you’ll learn that you were taking the wrong approach to begin with. Document it, learn from it, and move on. Adjust your inputs and try again.

Spinning down

Nothing is forever, and ending a project or program doesn’t mean it wasn’t successful. Sometimes it’s just not what the organization needs anymore, or something you don’t have the resources to continue. This is a case where you’ll want to carefully communicate the change and what it means for your stakeholders.

If the outputs that came from this work are going to be replaced or archived, what can people access in their place, if anything? Let them know the timeline for the change as soon as you can and be honest about why this particular support is ending.

Expanding

If you have the resources and need to expand something you’re already doing to more people or more scope, congratulations! Instead of just dialing up the “more” knob, however, take the time to consider how you want to fit into this new world.

One person told me about how the day to day work has changed as their team grows:

It's a bad habit/good habit from being a consultant, while the scope of my role was carefully, narrowly defined. [But] when I get into an organization, when I find gaps, I just flow into them, I fill them, I try to address them, I call them out.

I don't do very much of that anymore. I have a team now of three other people. Now I'm spending a lot of time dealing with management issues, running the team, which was a thing I said I never wanted to do when I joined. But the alternative was that I hire somebody else [who didn’t have accessibility experience, to manage the team].

Expanding the program doesn’t mean that your role has to expand too. Perhaps you want to try a new role, engage with new stakeholders, or shift your focus. If you’ve been focusing on strategy

and communications, maybe you want to instead dig into instructional design or advocacy.

Maintenance

Sometimes things are going well and they don’t need to be changed. However, maintenance comes with its own requirements. Even if your program (your system) isn’t changing, there are often outside influences that will change. Perhaps you need to change documentation when a tool your teams use is updated. Perhaps a stakeholder leaves, and you need to replace them with someone new on the same team.

Knowledge in our field is always changing, so even in a program where “nothing” changes, you’ll have a steady flow of work keeping up to date on changes in technology, new understandings of disability, and all the new and exciting ways capitalism is trying to fuck us over.

Scenarios

For the rest of this book, I’ll share three scenarios to show examples of assessing needs and creating goals, outputs, and outcome measures, using the theories and techniques we’ve explored. I’ll also provide examples of services and activities that might align well with each scenario, and examples of possible challenges.

We can’t cover every single possibility for each scenario, but I hope these give you some ideas you can apply in your own situation.

The scenarios are:

Ĉ. Chapter 15: Compliance+, which follows a project to assess risk and meet accessibility standards

ĉ. Chapter 16: Fostering a community, which explores considerations for building an accessibility community

Ċ. Chapter 17: Staying the course, which is about operationalizing an existing accessibility program

These chapters have a lot of “refresher” footnotes. These footnotes reference the chapter where I originally introduced a topic or idea. So you can read these upcoming chapters straight through as is, or you can dip back into previous chapters as you need.

Chapter summary

This chapter talked about setting goals in your program and how to measure them. Realistic goals that help you tap into larger trends in your organization are key to success.

Depending on your circumstance, it can be helpful to think about goals as needs or constraints. It can also sometimes help to define desired outcomes and create goals against them.

Depending on your goals, you’ll need to consider different lengths of time as well, with shorter term goals helping you in your day to day and longer-term goals helping in year-long or multi-year plans.

Chapter footnotes

A. If you are flipping or swiping to the end of the chapter and nervous about how short it is, don't worry. This chapter is the vaguest part of this whole book because what goals are good for you will depend so heavily on your situation. But the next three chapters will lay out some common scenarios with concrete goal-setting examples, so hold tight. [Return to text]

Chapter 15: Compliance+

Shell Little: If you stop seeing the people behind the defects, and just imagine the lawsuits, something is broken. It's also bad for actually creating good products. Compliant does not mean accessible. If we’re aiming for ‘just good enough to not get sued’ then we’re never going to achieve accessible experiences.

What you’ll read: In this chapter, you’ll consider a project on accessibility compliance. You’ll explore options for activities and priorities that might support this mission as a solo practitioner. You’ll also consider ways you can tie this work into a larger plan to establish a more sustainable effort.

Background

You are an individual contributor (IC) at a company that doesn’t have an established accessibility program. You do your best with what resources you have, but you find yourself one of a small number of people who seem to care about accessibility. As a vocal champion for accessibility, you draw the attention of a representative in your company’s legal team.

You learn that a disability advocacy non-profit made a complaint against your company for its inaccessible digital product. At the

time, leadership wasn’t convinced it was an issue that needed to be handled unless a lawsuit materialized. Now the non-profit is threatening to sue.

You (with the hesitant approval of your manager) have been asked to lead a charge to make your company’s core product compliant with WCAG 2.2 Level AA. The legal team rep (let’s call her Mandy) isn’t exactly sure what this will entail, and Mandy wants your help to start the process. Mandy is willing and able to help you get resources you need to do this work (“within reason”) and to help you get buy-in from the head of product. She also needs to provide a report of your organization’s efforts in 6 months. The report will be delivered to stakeholders in the non-profit and leadership in your company.

To do all this, she is looking to you to provide some possible scenarios for tackling this work that she can share with leadership and, eventually, the non-profit.

Questions and considerations

It might feel like you have to rush into an audit. A While an audit might be the right step, there are other questions you can ask and ways of thinking you can explore. You don’t want to just start and end with an audit-focused project. You want to get folks in our organization onboard for the long term. C Pausing to ask more questions now will make that easier.

Here are some example questions you can ask.

Why do we (the organization) want to do this work?

c

What’s the organizational climate around accessibility and equity? The organizational culture? D How can you learn more about those? E

What must change (if anything) within the organization for this work to be successful? How can we help facilitate that change? Can you grow community with this effort? G

F

Who can help? How can they help? Why might they want to help? H

Can you support equality and coalition at the organizational level through this effort?

Can you improve processes and workflows through this effort? Can you grow literacy with this effort? I

How can you cultivate operations thinking for this work? J

Here are some potential answers to these questions.

Why do we want to do this work?

Because we want to make sure our product is accessible.

Why? Because we’re not sure how accessible it is.

Why? Because we don’t currently have standards and processes around accessibility.

Why? Because those haven’t been prioritized.

Why? Because leadership’s interest in accessibility hinged on a legal threat.

None of this information would be news to you but it would probably be news to others. And it can be helpful to understand this throughline of thinking when you are talking to people about this work. There is a direct connection between the organization’s lack of commitment and planning and this situation, but that won't be obvious to everyone you engage with.

What’s the organizational climate around accessibility and equity? The organizational culture? How can you learn more about those?

Accessibility isn’t on everyone’s radar, so it’s safe to say that it’s not a big part of your company’s climate. You also know it’s not part of your company’s official culture, since you know how leadership thinks about it.

You’ll probably learn more about the accessibility climate as you talk with people from different teams and learn how inaccessible the product is.

To learn more about culture, you should consider what your organization says it cares about to help get people to invest in this work. You should also consider what your organization says it cares about to decide what work to prioritize once you get your assessment or audit results. For example, let’s say that one of your company values is making a product for “everyone.” This is

potentially something you can use when you are talking with product leaders and teams about this work.

Depending on how leadership reacts to the report, there’s also the potential to start shifting the culture.

What must change (if anything) within the organization for this work to be successful? How can we help facilitate that change?

You know from experience that getting an organization to take accessibility seriously isn’t easy. While you might be able to marshal the resources to get the product compliant for a moment in time to avoid the current legal risk, avoiding risk in the future will take more time and work. And shifting to a usability and equity mindset instead of a compliance mindset will take even more time and work.

You also know from our pillars of anti-ableism that long-term change is going to require shifting how people think about equity, how people work in coalition together, how people do their work, and how much they can grow in their accessibility literacy. That’s a lot, so we probably need to dig further into this to consider what might be feasible to start in the short term. It also means we need to put a lot of emphasis on relationships with people as stakeholders for this project and as collaborators for the long term.

Can you grow community with this effort?

There are two places where I think you can consider growing community. One is with your existing accessibility-minded

colleagues. They can potentially be comrades or champions in this work.

Another is the non-profit that’s reached out. Since the non-profit itself or perhaps the people it serves want to be able to use the product, there’s a big opportunity here to engage with them and collaborate. Perhaps individuals there might be able to help you do usability testing (for compensation, of course). Perhaps they can help you humanize disabled people and put their needs into context for people in your company. Perhaps there’s the opportunity for a formal partnership between your company and the non-profit. That would be a great source of cross-community learning for both groups.

Who can help? How can they help? Why might they want to help?

For these questions, you should consider the colleagues you already work with informally around accessibility. You can review your chat history, authors on documents you’ve co-written, or any other evidence of the people you know value this work. You can consider how they can help based on their roles, the facets of accessibility that interest them, and the strengths you’ve discovered as you work with them. You’ll probably also be able to tell why they might want to help you from what they value and what they’ve done in the past.

At the very least, these folks can probably support you by acting as liaisons between you and their teams. They can also act as experts on their different parts of the product, so you don’t have to take on

all that knowledge and expertise yourself. Ultimately, they are good candidates to be stakeholders for the project and comrades and champions in the long term.

Can you support equality and coalition at the organizational level through this effort?

Since you’re starting with nothing, this is probably a pillar we should prioritize. We’re going to learn a lot, good and bad, about how people think about this work during this project. Even if we can’t sow seeds of equity and coalition right now, we should collect information through our interactions with people to help inform what that sowing might look like. We can take notes (on the record and off) as we progress to give us ideas for creating a more sustainable program. And, if our company has an existing DEI program, we can consider how we can leverage that.

Can you improve processes and workflows through this effort?

The answer to this question is very similar to the previous one. We’re going to learn a lot about how people currently do or don’t do their work. If we work with a vendor, they will probably recommend specific tools or practices for us to take on, as well.

Can you grow literacy with this effort?

Literacy is probably too far a stretch for this project. While you’d ideally be able to explore ways to educate people and help them

develop literacy before they start doing deep accessibility work, that might not be feasible, depending on how bad things are and how urgent the timeline is. This is probably going to be a low priority for now.

How can you cultivate an operations mindset for this work?

This will be tricky. Since this is all happening very fast, you’ll find yourself having to be very hands on. But we have a huge opportunity to observe everyone involved, identify gaps or pain points, celebrate successes, and take notes to help us consider what we could operationalize in the future.

This is a big project with a lot of moving parts, so we should explore our options to break it down into smaller parts. To do that, we can use our logic model. K

Figure 28: Our beloved logic model.

Potential inputs

Needs

We’ve identified two critical needs:

Ĉ. We need to know how inaccessible the product is.

ĉ. We need to work with Mandy to produce a report about those findings and to communicate our plan.

However, exactly what we document for number 2 hinges on number 1. That will set the direction for any decisions or recommendations we make. That’s a lot at stake, so we should be careful to consider activities that we can run simultaneously. This will help lighten the weight of that dependency and will hopefully mean we’re not sitting on our hands at any point. It also means we are going to have multiple things in flight at once, so we will need to rely on help from others.

Constraints

For this scenario, our limited resources and some external pressures mean that we have some major constraints on all of our inputs, including our resources, goals, and people. L One is time, since we have an initial 6-month deadline to deliver a report. However, that deadline isn’t to fix everything. It’s to report the situation, (hopefully) create an initial plan, (hopefully) start to move the organization in the right direction of addressing the problem, and clearly communicate about it.

Another constraint is budget. Depending on what you decide to recommend, you may be limited for options, such as working with a vendor or buying an enterprise tool. You probably can’t hire additional full-time staff, for example.

There are probably other constraints that we’ll think of as we begin to plan. You also know that if you focus solely on compliance and remediation, that won’t address the issue of why the product is inaccessible in the first place. M You’ve technically been asked to do a compliance task, but it’s really (hopefully) compliance plus some early program exploration. We’ll take that into account in how we make decisions.

Resources

You do have some budget, even if that amount isn’t super clear. Other resources will make themselves known as we learn more. You also have your skills and talents, Mandy’s skills and talents, and possibly the support of your colleagues. It's not much, but it's not nothing! We can expand on these people-related resources when we talk about our People input.

Goals

Since this scenario is happening under duress, let’s go with our simplest goal-setting tactic by using our needs as goals: Our primary goal is to produce a report in 6 months. But to do that, we need to do a lot of preparation, research, and communication.

This project is going to need to involve a lot of people, inside your organization and out. Some of these people will be stakeholders, and others will be both stakeholders and collaborators. At least to start, we know that we have:

Yourself Mandy from legal, your sponsor Your informal accessibility community Product leadership Product teams Senior leadership Stakeholders at the non-profit

If you’re visually inclined, you can map these things out in your logic model.

Figure 29: Inputs with our details filled in.

Potential outputs or activities

This isn’t a formal program (yet), so let's skip services for now. Currently everything we're doing is in service of this legal issue. But,

we can think about what products we might make during this work, and what participation we might require from people. N

Some of these activities have to happen before others. Some might have dependencies. Some might have different audiences. Considering these things can help us figure out what order we might work in, or how we might divide the work. One thing that makes this tricky is that we need to work very closely with internal stakeholders to keep everything moving. We need to have a level of flexibility, but we also need buy-in early so that people trust us and what we’re doing. It might also be worth considering some checkpoints in our project, so that we can stop and assess where we are and if we need to change our plans.

There is no right or wrong way to explore this. What you’re doing at this stage is pre-planning. You’re holding an object in your hands and turning it, feeling its textures, observing its colors, and sketching out your ideas about how you might capture it in a useful way.

Here is one way I might think about it, using the same approach I took with inputs and outputs. Again, nothing is set in stone here. We’re brainstorming. This is jazz.

Participation

While really sitting and stewing in outputs, I came up with some specific forms of participation that I hadn’t documented before:

Fixing issues

Signing off on checkpoints

Celebrating progress

Information decisions

Receiving information

All of these relate to ways that different people might take part in this process. These are good points to bring up with your sponsor, since they will force you to start making decisions about responsibilities. Who should sign off on checkpoints in remediation, for example? Who should get informed? How? How often? These are all things to consider in how you communicate about this project. You don’t have to make these decisions all up front, but you know you need to make them at some point.

Products

For products, we have at least one we have to make. But there are others we could produce as forms of documentation:

6-month report

Test plan

Test results

Repair plan and schedule

Some kind of community that comes out of engaging with stakeholders

You might notice a trend where a lot of this work is about documentation, communication, and maintaining relationships with a lot of people. That’s not just your gut telling you that; you have data telling you that now too!

Personally, I think even at this stage it’s clear that you need help to get the assessment done. It’s probably in your best interest to try to offload as much work as you can that’s not that. That means telling Mandy that finding a vendor to do the testing is a high priority, so you two can focus on the people work while testing happens. This will require a lot of up-front collaboration but should pay off in the long run. It also means that you’re going to depend heavily on your close colleagues, but primarily for information that’s already at their disposal, namely how their teams work and collaborate.

Now you’ve got some solid considerations to share with your sponsor. You’re not just rushing into a time-consuming audit without knowing what you want to do with the results. You can show Mandy that you’re taking this seriously and are thinking about how this work might go, and the types of resources and support you might need. You and Mandy can then come to agreement on how you want to approach this work and start to take steps to divide up tasks.

Figure 30: Possible outputs for our logic model.

Potential outcomes

To evaluate our project, we want to be able to fulfill the needs we defined at the beginning of the chapter. How we meet these needs will form the core of the project’s results. We won’t know the exact outcomes until the project runs its course, but we can think about some possibilities. O

Let's be careful to constrain ourselves to the goals we must meet, rather than the ones we might want to meet, like starting a real program! If this effort goes well, perhaps we can work toward that next. But for now, let's set up our logic model system for success with a clear purpose. P

Results

Our effort's results should reflect how we meet (or don’t meet) our goals. Our results should answer the questions:

Ĉ. How accessible is the product?

ĉ. Did we deliver a report to the non-profit?

The answer to the first question will depend on the results of the assessment. The answer to the second question is a simple yes/no. This part is pretty straightforward. What will be less straightforward is the breadth of impacts we might experience.

Impacts

This project may have a big impact on how the organization addresses accessibility moving forward. Based on what you know about accessibility work (and what you’ve read in this book), what

types of impacts do you imagine? We can document these as questions we want to answer now. Here are a few that come to mind for me:

Do we start using new processes to integrate accessibility thinking and doing?

Do we start using new tools to address accessibility work?

Do we engage a vendor? How does this impact our tools and processes?

Do we end up avoiding legal issues with the non-profit? How does this impact our relationship with them?

Does this work strengthen and grow our accessibility community of practice?

Do we develop a new community that includes the non-profit?

Other possible impacts may appear as this project happens, but these are some to anticipate.

Next steps

And finally, the vaguest of the vague at this point: what next steps might we make? One way to consider next steps is to return to the questions we asked at the beginning of the chapter. How do our answers to those questions change over the course of the project? Are they resolved? Are they still open-ended?

What trends do you find in your outcomes? Does your updated information indicate that things are pretty much the same? Or is

there evidence that you can change your tactics? Maybe you can start building a program.

Figure 31: Some hypothetical outcomes for this project.

Even without a lot of concrete outcomes, all of these pieces together are quite powerful, and they can be part of your conversations with your sponsor. Consider the feedback loops of information this would give you, and how much you will learn. If you do move forward with building a program, you will already have a lot of information to use to make decisions.

Figure 32: The three parts of our proposed logic model all together.

Ultimately, it’s important to keep in mind that you are fulfilling two roles for this project: you are an accessibility specialist, but you are also a project manager—a facilitator. An operator. A relationshipminder. It’s not your job to fix teams’ issues. It’s your job to get them the information they need to make improvements, support them, and document, document, document.

Doing two jobs at once isn’t sustainable, which you need to take into account in your outcomes too.

The best thing you can do in this situation is to document everything and be able to answer any “why” questions (or know where to find the answers) if things don’t turn out the way stakeholders want them to. Your job is to make recommendations, triage severity of impact on users, monitor what happens, and collect all the information you can from the experience. When you can take a breath, you’ll already have a lot of information at your disposal that you (or someone else) can turn into training materials, tooling, and maturity analysis. Nothing, even failures, will have gone to waste.

Chapter summary

In this chapter, you explored ways to think about a compliancebased project. This included pausing to examine ways you could leverage a push for compliance into longer-term programming and relationship-building. It also included brainstorming activities and possible directions to find trends and inform next steps.

Chapter 16: Fostering a community

Susan Bustetter: We need consistent people from every agency involved together, listening to each other, learning from each other, bringing in experts when needed to keep moving forward on accessibility and usability.

What you’ll read: In this chapter, you will explore a scenario for growing and sustaining an accessibility community of practice. You’ll consider goals, priorities, and measures of success that focus on community, process, and workflows.

Background

You just moved to a new city and got a new job as a UX writer. Congrats!

At your previous company, you were an active champion in the accessibility community. It was a great experience, but the memory is a bit soured. A few months before you left, there was churn in the accessibility team, and several people left for other jobs. You and other champions did your best to step up and fill gaps that were left in the accessibility community, but you got burned out by doing this work on top of your “real” job.

After you finish onboarding and you get your bearings, you’re surprised about the lack of accessibility maturity at your new company. Since your new company is much bigger and more established, you rashly assumed that it would have a mature accessibility program. And during your interview, when you asked about accessibility at the company, the responses you got seemed very positive. “Oh, yes!” one interviewer said. “We do that here! It’s everyone’s responsibility.”

What you find here instead is a discussion channel that’s dedicated to accessibility. There are a lot of people lurking in it, but it mostly consists of new people popping in to ask questions and leaving when they’re answered. A handful of regulars respond to questions. You look these folks up and find many of them are your peers on other product teams. You start responding to questions too when you can, and folks are very friendly and kind. But, the ad hoc vibe makes you a little worried, because you don’t want to get too invested or do too much while you learn the ropes of your new job.

You decide you do want to be involved, but that you’re going to have to be very careful with boundaries. You want to make connections in your new accessibility community, but you also want to avoid burning out again.

You think about how you got involved in the accessibility community at your old job. Your introduction was attending an accessibility community of practice meeting with a colleague. A The meetings were monthly and run by different members of the accessibility

team, as well as other members of the community. That’s probably as good a place to start as any!

You toss out an idea to the channel: What if we create community of practice around accessibility, outside of just this channel? This would create the opportunity to explore other activities, not just things that fit in a chat window.

Most people in the channel don’t respond, but the responses you get are extremely positive. But since it’s your idea, they expect you to lead it. You decide to investigate how you could best support a community without taking a high-demand leadership position for yourself.

Needs

Before diving in, you need to identify, well, the community need. A community of practice seems like a good idea, and it’s something you have experience with. But you think you should do some research or collaborate with the group to identify what would best fit the needs of the organization climate. From there you can decide if a community of practice would be a good fit and go from there.

You should also let your manager in on the idea. You want to be transparent about this being something you might spend time on. And, ideally, this is something that can formally contribute to your professional development.

Accessibility is the right thing to do, but in a corporate setting it’s always good to get credit for contributing to the organization

climate if you can. So, you decide to pitch the idea to your manager and identify ways that this can help meet your goals in fulfilling and furthering your IC role while keeping it to just that—your current role.

Constraints

In this scenario, your major constraint is your own time. You’re still getting used to your new city and your new job, and you don’t want to take on too much. You also want to be careful to not set yourself up as an accessibility specialist, much less the accessibility specialist, and you don’t want to accidentally find yourself in any kind of official leadership role.

Resources

One of your resources is your own prior knowledge of what participating in a formal community of practice was like at your last job.

Another is information about your new company, which you can probably learn from talking to people and looking at documentation. Since you haven’t been at the company long, you know you’ll need to do some work to figure out how a community of practice might fit into the company.

And you’ll want to get input from the other people in the discussion channel. You know everyone is pressed for time, though. You’ll want to be strategic about when you bring them in for feedback.

Questions and considerations

This is a much less serious scenario than the one we had in Chapter 15: Compliance+. As a result, you don’t need to be as stringent with your initial questions. But you will still save yourself time and effort if you spend some energy up front to get more information and more clarity around what you’re trying to do. To that end, you can ask the same types of questions we did in the last chapter. Here are some questions and possible answers to those questions.

Why do you want to do this work?

C

Why would the organization want to do this work?

What’s the organizational climate around accessibility and equity? The organizational culture? How can you learn more about those? c

What must change (if anything) within the organization for this work to be successful? How can we help facilitate that change?

D

Can you grow community with this effort?

Who can help? How can they help? Why might they want to help? E

Can you support equality and coalition at the organizational level through this effort? F

Can you improve processes and workflows through this effort?

Can you grow literacy with this effort?

How can you cultivate an operations mindset for this work? G

Why do you want to do this work?

Because you see people struggling to do something you think is important, in a way that reminds you of a way you struggled with it. You have empathy and sympathy for them.

Why? Because doing accessibility work is difficult and often lacks support.

Why? Because accessibility work is often done reactively instead of proactively, and reactive work is more disruptive. H

Why? Accessibility work isn’t part of the norm.

Why? Because it’s not something that our society values by default, where the default is ableism.

Since you don’t know much about the climate and culture of your organization yet, it’s hard to say if accessibility is something that the organization might actually value right now. Tackling ableism in your organization feels like a tall order, but that doesn’t have to be your primary goal.

You want to support the other people who already think this is important; you’re not trying to convince people that it’s important (at least not yet). So your primary goal is to help elevate and support the existing, informal accessibility community you’ve observed in a way that works for you. That’s much more realistic and doable.

Why would the organization want to do this work?

Because, sooner or later, the organization is going to need to face its lack of preparedness in this area.

Why? Because there might be a legal complaint or lawsuit, or because they might expand into a market where accessibility is currently taken more seriously. Because the company surely already has disabled customers and employees. Because it’s the right thing to do.

Why? Because doing accessibility work proactively is always a better use of everyone's time and resources than doing it reactively.

Why? Because the work is complicated and has many moving parts. There is no quick fix.

Why? Because accessibility work is as complicated as the people we do it for. I

What’s the organizational climate around accessibility and equity? The organizational culture? How can you learn more about those?

Based on your brief exposure so far, you know that there is a small effort on the part of some ICs to contribute to accessibility knowledge. But you’re still new, so you don’t know all the ins and outs of that climate yet.

As far as culture goes, you haven’t seen anything from leadership that explicitly calls for accessible products and inclusive culture around accessibility. You’ll need to talk to folks who have been

around longer and do some digging in the company wiki to learn more.

What must change (if anything) within the organization for this work to be successful? How can we help facilitate that change?

At present, there appears to be a pocket of the organization dedicating itself to accessibility as volunteers. While other people are asking questions, only a small number of colleagues are trying to answer those questions.

It seems like making this more sustainable requires bringing more people into the fold, or finding other ways to get people’s questions answered.

This will probably take shifting the organizational climate to be readier to take on accessibility work as a whole. You’re not ready to press on the culture, but you can make inroads to shifting the climate. And through this project, you can hopefully find some clues about what that change might require, and who might help you begin that change.

Can you grow community with this effort?

You hope so!

Who can help? How can they help? Why might they want to help?

You think the people already volunteering their time and knowledge in the channel can support you. But they already seem overwhelmed. You might need to convince them that they can collaborate up front to make their advocacy easier later. You’ll want to make getting their input very easy for them by doing it over chat or in brief calls or meetings.

You may also want to look for other possible allies. One place to start would be to do a deeper dive into who asks questions in the channel to look for patterns. Patterns I would look for might include these:

What teams are represented?

Are there specific people who ask a lot of questions?

What questions are asked over and over?

What questions don’t get answered?

Do any internal or external resources come up in questions or answers?

Are there people who seem to have a bit more literacy when it comes to dealing with accessibility issues?

All these questions can help guide you toward getting more information from places like your company wiki. J Getting more familiar with that will be a huge help.

Can you support equality and coalition at the organizational level through this effort?

Yes, you think so. You don’t imagine you can cause harm in this area if you proceed carefully and thoughtfully. Part of your internal research should probably be about any disability or inclusion-related groups or teams that might be good collaborators or guides.

Can you improve processes and workflows through this effort?

Yes, you think so. At your old company, the accessibility community of practice was a place where folks talked about what their teams were doing around accessibility, and it was a great way to compare notes and get feedback.

You recognize that a community here might be able to influence whoever makes decisions about tools, processes, and workflows for teams. K That would be an important step for the maturity of the company which would depend on creating and refining processes and workflows. L

Can you grow literacy with this effort?

Yes, you think so. The community at your old job was informally responsible for a lot of the updates to the accessibility documentation you used internally, which got refined through lots of use. As a result, a lot of people in the community were very familiar with the documentation and got very good at recommending resources to new folks to solve the accessibility problems people in the company faced most often. There’s the potential to build the same kind of infrastructure here.

How can you cultivate an operations mindset for this work?

It might be a bit early to already start thinking too hard about operationalizing (especially because you don’t want to get saddled with any specific responsibilities that might lead to burnout). But the information you learn about the organization will be very helpful later on. At the very least, you might be able to begin a paper trail that proves useful for later, more formal efforts, even if those happen after your time at the company. Your contributions might be information that the next person in your position can use.

And focusing on literacy now will make it easier for a future specialist to focus on operations. If people are more comfortable evaluating information about accessibility themselves in community, they’ll be less likely to require a lot of hand-holding.

Goals

There are a couple of ways of looking at this project from a goals perspective. M

On one hand, your hope is to establish a community of practice. Or, if not that, to establish something else to help raise the visibility of accessibility and take the burden off the small number of people who seem to care about it.

On the other hand, this is also a personal project. You have the potential to fit this work into your personal goals for the year as part

of your quarterly reviews with your manager. You can also use this as an opportunity to grow other skills outside of your main IC work. You can plan to review the objectives you’re meant to address and see if this work would fit into them at all.

Primary goal

Initially you thought your primary goal was to create a community of practice, but after consideration you realize that you don’t know if that’s the right outcome. Instead, your goal will be to investigate the needs the organization has around accessibility and brainstorm some ideas to meet those needs. N Remember that sometimes work includes figuring out what the work should be! O

Secondary goal

You have one secondary goal: To use this work to demonstrate that you’re meeting (and ideally exceeding) the requirements and responsibilities of your IC role. This will help you in conversations with your manager.

Potential outputs and outcomes

After going through your list of questions, you might be a bit overwhelmed by the many directions this project could take. This is even more reason to keep yourself to your goal and give yourself very clear ways to measure success. P

Since this is partly about professional development for you, you might use key performance indicators (KPIs) and objectives and key results (OKRs) to measure your progress and how successful you are. In this scenario, ideally, you’d create KPIs with your manager around your goals, your team’s goals, and the requirements for your role. They also might need to fit certain expectations for KPIs at your organization or in your role.

Let’s break down your primary and secondary priorities to assign some possible outputs and outcomes.

For the professional development side of things, let’s say that you have a set list of requirements for progressing in your IC role that you can use to measure yourself against. For the sake of argument, let’s say that “Process and collaboration” is a requirement. That’s your goal, or OKR. Let’s say there are some canned measure, or KPIs, you can use for your role, or you can create your own with your manager. You can define outputs that meet those KPIs. These can usually be vague—much more vague than what you’re actually trying to do.

OKR: Process and collaboration

Example outputs

Investigate options for improving accessibility communication across the organization.

Collaborate with cross-team colleagues in the accessibility channel to support accessibility ideation across the

organization.

Example KPIs

Support team in refining process or workflow for continuous integration

Demonstrate collaboration with teammates in other roles

Demonstrate leadership in collaborating on cross-team or cross-org projects

For the day-to-day work on this project, you should start with the questions you struggled to answer. Getting answers to those will need to be your first step if you’re going to create something that has a chance of being sustainable. That’s part of the work.

These thoughts might be something you keep to yourself, but you can share with your manager, if you feel supported by them. You can also share with the colleagues you’re collaborating with, if you feel you can trust them to be comradely about it. In any case, this is mostly for you, to help keep you on track and within the boundaries you’re setting for yourself.

Here's what your private notes about the work might look like.

Explore a community of practice

Ideas about what to do

Learn more about where the organization is in its accessibility journey

One-on-one or in small groups with accessibility channel regulars to learn more about their knowledge, goals in taking part, and their takes on the organizational climate around accessibility

Ask those folks for recommendations to talk to others

Search for any documentation or internal files related to accessibility, disability, equity, inclusion, etc., in the internal wiki to get a read on the organizational culture and climate around accessibility

Search for any documentation or internal files related to other communities of practice on this or other topics

Make connections

Reach out to any people that come up in those searches (if they’re still around) to see if there are updates

Reach out to folks that the channel regulars recommend

Possible outcomes

Understand how ready the community is to do any kind of initiative

Understand the organization’s climate and culture around accessibility better

Identify gaps in the organization’s processes and knowledge

Brainstorm ideas for topics and activities for the community

Identify people with knowledge the community can use to learn and grow

Feel confident that kicking off a community of practice is a good idea and a good fit for the climate

Schedule a kickoff meeting and invite people you’ve already connected with to start working together

This might feel like a lot of up-front work, and it is. You’re in the preplanning stages of this project, and it’s important to recognize what real work that is! Before you jump into starting a community, you want to do your due diligence to make sure that’s the right strategy and that it won’t fizzle out immediately.

You’re checking to see how viable your garden bed is. That way, you don’t plant your seeds in soil that’s missing important nutrients.

Chapter summary

In this chapter, you read a scenario about strengthening the accessibility community at a new job. It focused on keeping very clear boundaries on the work, as well as tying it into your requirements for your role. It emphasized doing research into community readiness and making connections before kicking off a community. This will help ensure that it’s the right thing to do, that it will be well received, and that it can be successful.

Chapter 17: Staying the course

Natalie Patrice Tucker: I'm building my career ladder as I sit on it.

What you’ll read: In this chapter, you’ll explore a scenario for sustaining and growing an established accessibility program with multiple practitioners. You’ll weigh options for what to prioritize to maintain momentum and meet leaderships’ goals while your resources on paper stay the same.

Background

You are an accessibility specialist and accessibility team lead at a company that has a new accessibility program. The program was established after an accessibility complaint against the company was settled out of court. Leadership has bought in, but they seem most engaged by the good PR associated with making the company product accessible.

On the accessibility team, you lead three other specialists, Riho, Jamie, and Caprice. This is the biggest your team has been, but it always seems like there’s still more work than the team can handle.

Due to budget cuts across the company, you know your team can’t expect to hire anyone else in the coming year, and you’re not going

to get any additional budget or resources. You’ll need to make do with the resources you have in the upcoming year.

At the same time, leadership is asking when your team thinks the organization can be bumped up from its current level of accessibility maturity (Launch) to the next level (Integrate). A They explain that they are engaging a well-known disabled speaker to come to the organization’s internal conference in the spring of next year, and they’d like to use that event to announce that the organization is on target to reach the next level.

To discuss this and kick off your regular annual planning for next year, you gather your team to review your information and resources, and to brainstorm what activities your team should prioritize as a group next year.

To prep for this meeting, you reread the accessibility maturity report you published and find that the biggest maturity gaps are in hiring and culture. These are areas that you haven’t made a lot of inroads in.

Team members

You and the specialists who report to you all have different backgrounds. You are all disabled, and all have different needs and preferences around how you work.

You

You started out as a UX designer with some front-end engineering experience. While you’ve mostly handed in your designer hat for your manager one, you do still run workshops with designers and advocate for more user research, especially with disabled users. You have ADHD and several chronic pain disorders.

As a team and people lead, you attend a lot of meetings and juggle a lot of responsibilities, so you have to be extremely careful about scheduling your time and managing your illness. But, it’s often a challenge to not overcommit.

Riho

Riho came into accessibility work as a front-end engineer. She has low vision and social anxiety. She’s a systems thinker, and she is very well-versed in WCAG and the other W3C specs. She is the main technical person on your team, and she does a lot of work with the organization’s community of practice for front-end engineers and the design system team.

She prefers providing direct support to individuals through office hours and chat. Large groups and high-demand settings are a no go, unless she’s got lots of time to prepare and she feels supported.

Jamie

Jamie has a background in instructional design. They have EhlersDanlos Syndrome (EDS) and sometimes use mobility aids. They usually work from home, sometimes outside business hours. This

works with their role, which mostly focuses on resources that people can use to learn about accessibility on their own time or developing training that anyone on the team can run.

Jamie is also a co- lead for the company’s ERG for disabled employees.

Caprice

Caprice entered the accessibility space through broader DEI work and ERG facilitation. He was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia a couple of years ago. After learning more about his own accessibility needs, he got interested in accessibility work and joined your team.

He is your team’s primary facilitator and trainer, and the de facto leader of your accessibility community of practice. He’s a people person, and he loves connecting people with common interests, especially interest in DEI topics. He seems to know everyone in the company.

Needs

To meet the request from leadership and to do your actual job, there are two main needs. C

For leadership, you need to evaluate and report on whether you think your company is on track to reach the next level of accessibility maturity next year. You probably already have a gut answer to this (“Hell, no!”), but you should spend some time collecting and reviewing data to be sure. c

You also need to do your regular annual planning to decide your team’s main activities for the coming year.

Constraints and dependencies

In this scenario, you have two major constraints. You can’t get any new resources or staff, so you need to make do with the resources and time you and your team can already commit to.

And, since the areas you would need to tackle for a higher rating are hiring and culture, you’ll need to engage with internal teams like HR, so their constraints will become yours too. You’ll probably need to make some changes to the services your team provides since making new inroads with teams will take up time.

Resources

You have the same budget, headcount, champion network (your community of practice), sponsors, and stakeholders you had last year.

Current services and activities

Before you can consider what types of services or activities to do next year, let’s say what you’ve been doing this year. D You’ve been attempting to support different learning styles and meet individuals and teams where they are in a few different ways. E Your company has a physical office with a lot of leniency to work at home for many roles, so some activities are hybrid and some are online-only.

Office hours

Office hours are held for 3 hours for 3 days every week over Zoom or occasionally in person. They are mostly attended by ICs and staffed on rotation by your team. These are very popular and relatively well-attended. During busy times of the year, people sometimes need to book 2–3 weeks in advance. During other times in the year, attendance goes down, and the team finds themselves doing other things during those times.

Self-guided courses

These online courses are aimed at ICs and PMs/POs who can take them at their own pace through the company’s LMS. Some of these courses are required, and some are optional. The optional courses are mostly taken by folks in the accessibility community of practice, but there are occasionally names of people you don’t recognize in the logs.

These courses are primarily designed by Jamie, with input from other members of your team and your community of practice.

Accessibility Handbook

This is part of the company’s internal wiki. It lets anyone within the company look up information about the accessibility program, the organization’s expectations around accessibility, internal best practices, and what resources and services are available for teams.

The Handbook is primarily maintained by your team, but ICs (mostly more senior ones) contribute to it as well. This gets a lot of traffic and is frequently praised by ICs as an important resource they rely on heavily to do their jobs.

Everyone on the team contributes to this. Jamie informally owns keeping the information architecture tidy.

Design workshops

Four times a year, you run a two-day, hybrid in-person-and-overZoom accessible design and research workshop for designers. This is a legacy project from your UX role before the accessibility team started. New designers appreciate this hands-on approach, since you can dig into real problems in depth.

This isn’t as time consuming for you as it used to be, since you have your slides, examples, and activities down pat. But it still takes a chunk of your time every quarter that always stresses you out. Jamie has offered to help you if you ever want to refresh it.

Lunch-and-learns

Every month, your team hosts an informal session over Zoom around the middle of the day for most employees. Topics come from the Accessibility Handbook and things that come up a lot in office hours. You record these sessions. Most attendees are from outside your community of practice, so it’s a great way to get feedback from people who are newer to accessibility.

Caprice is the primary host for these sessions, but sometimes others host or co-host if the topic is more related to their expertise.

Accessibility onboarding

Since your program is still new, not every team in the company is on board yet. When you start supporting a new team, your team gives an orientation to all of your offerings, in person or over Zoom. This is mostly a way for you to do outreach and connect with teams.

You don’t do these too often, but they tend to be intensive because teams have a lot of questions out of the gate. These sessions are run by you and one other specialist.

Accessibility champions network

This cross-organization community of practice meets monthly over Zoom. The group usually decides on their own topics and activities during meetings. Sometimes if your team sees trends (either good ones or bad ones) that they feel should have focus, you use this group as a way to discuss them. You have a lot of people in the group, and regularly see a few dozen in calls.

Caprice is the primary facilitator for the group, but other members of the community volunteer as well.

Teams chat support

Your organization uses the Teams app for chat, and your team manages a channel dedicated to accessibility. Mostly your team

spend this time pointing folks to existing resources, but sometimes they answer questions directly too. A lot of the folks who hang out here are also in the community of practice, but you also have a lot of lurkers who say they learn a lot just by “listening” in.

There is no official lead for the channel, but Riho is the most frequent contributor from your team.

Goals

You have a few different goals. F Leadership has given you one. You also have your own goals to set around how you want to grow your program, support your organization, and help your teammates continue to develop their skills. Since we already have our goals, let’s discuss them first, and then we’ll go through our questions.

Leadership (external) goal

It’s pretty clear from leadership’s request that they want to level up this coming year, at least from a PR perspective. You’ll have to figure out if you can address this, and how.

Team goals

These are the goals your team has for your program.

Reduce gaps in maturity

Identify what can be done to provide value even if next level isn’t feasible (a contingency plan)

Maintain or expand level of service across the organization next year

Professional development goals

Everyone on your team has goals for their professional development. These are the goals you have for yourself, the specialists who report to you. In no particular order, those goals are:

Caprice: Learn more about training and instructional design (especially for cognitive and developmental disabilities)

Jamie: Strengthen facilitation skills for ERG support and office hours

Riho: Grow skills around presenting and training (in a safe environment!)

You: Get better at saying no

Questions and considerations

As you go through this preparation and discussions with your team, you might ask yourself some questions to help you think through what challenges you might encounter.

Why do we need to go up a level in maturity? G

What organizational values, mission, or goals can we use to prioritize the work?

What’s the organizational climate around accessibility and equity? The organizational culture? How can you learn more

about those?

H

What must change (if anything) within the organization for this work to be successful? How can we help facilitate that change? Can you grow community with this effort?

I

Who can help? How can they help? Why might they want to help? J

Can you support equality and coalition at the organizational level through this effort? K

Can you improve processes and workflows through this effort? Can you grow literacy with this effort?

How can you cultivate an operations mindset for this work? L

Here are some potential answers to these questions.

Why do we need to go up a level in maturity?

Leadership would like us to.

Why? Because they are planning a high-profile event and want to announce our progress.

Why? Because they’ve gotten hooked on accessibility as a way to improve their public image.

Why? Because that was one of the reasons we gave them when we were trying to formalize the program.

Why? Because that’s what they care about.

What organizational values, mission, or goals can we use to prioritize the work?

Even if it feels restrictive, leadership’s goal to level up is a potential set of guardrails for your activities this year. It’s worth investigating and seeing if you can meet their goals and yours at the same time, or if they are in opposition to each other. Otherwise, for the sake of argument, you can use this year’s company theme, “Performance.”

What’s the organizational climate around accessibility and equity? The organizational culture? How can you learn more about those?

You’ve already thought about the organizational culture through our first question. As far as the climate goes, you’ve garnered a lot of good will over the past year. There are teams you haven’t worked with yet, but based on your teams’ experiences, the climate is trending toward “better” regarding accessibility. If you do run into barriers, they are usually put up by people who appear overwhelmed and unsupported, not outright hostile or adversarial. You can sympathize with them.

What must change (if anything) within the organization for this work to be successful? How can we help facilitate that change?

You could potentially just do what you did last year and maintain your level of success, which might not require a lot of change. But, since you’ve functionally been asked to level up the organization

without additional resources, any changes you make will need to be made with your current collective resources and abilities.

Barring additional headcount or cash, you will likely have to rely on your current relationships and make new ones if you want to create change. You also suspect that your team is already at capacity, so you want to figure out ways to reduce their current workload if possible.

Can you grow community with this effort?

Community is probably going to need to be a focus for the year to pull everything off. Hopefully this will also help with literacy.

Who can help? How can they help? Why might they want to help?

You’ve already considered reaching out to DEIB, HR, and the disability ERG. A group you interact with a lot but haven’t tapped into as a community are PM/POs. Perhaps they can provide support.

Can you support equality and coalition at the organizational level through this effort?

If you use leaderships’ directive and potentially focus on gaps between maturity levels, that would mean working directly with HR and the also new, small diversity, equity, inclusivity, and belonging (DEIB) team. The DEIB team has been very heads down, but directive or no, you have the potential to collaborate with them.

You’re not looking forward to reaching out to HR because of your own experiences with requesting accommodations, but it probably has to happen sooner or later.

On a more positive note, Jamie’s interest in developer her skills to lead the disability ERG is also an opportunity to support equality.

Can you improve processes and workflows through this effort?

Most of the things you’ve considered so far are about people and optics. You probably won’t focus on processes and workflows this year, but you’ll still need to help maintain the ones that are in place. Maybe the community of practice is a place to focus on this?

Can you grow literacy with this effort?

While you haven’t specifically focused on literacy yet, it’s always been nagging at you since the program started. You suspect there will be growing pains, but ideally you can start to wean ICs and teams off of so much hands-on support by your team, forcing them to improve their literacy. Especially without more resources! You consider reducing hours put into chat support, office hours, and other hands-on meetings to give the team more time to expand selfserve resources.

How can you cultivate an operations mindset for this work?

So far you’ve considered a few things that are operations-oriented, such as offloading more responsibility to ICs and teams. You might be able to free up some of your own time too, if you can brainstorm ways to be less hands-on in meetings and workshops. And a third way might be to put more emphasis on your team’s self-serve resources.

Priorities

There are a lot of moving parts here. To help keep everyone focused, you lay out your thinking for the team. As a group, you go through all of the activities and services you can think of, as well as any objectives or goals you have. Some of these things are big and some are small, and that’s okay.

The good news is that you can feed two birds with one scone here: You can get a read on what your team wants to focus on and you can also try to weed out high-effort, high-touch tasks in the name of leaning into operations.

Priorities for team activities and responsibilities

You use an Eisenhower matrix to try to wrap your heads around what’s actually most critical for you to accomplish in the coming year. M Once you sort the items on your list, you end up with the following groups.

Important and urgent

These are all activities or needs that work for the year will hinge on, so you need to get started on them soon.

Engaging with HR Engaging with DEIB Increasing accessibility literacy for ICs

Important and not urgent

These are activities that are important to do or maintain. However, they don’t require immediate changes and attention, or they’re not more urgent than items in the Important and urgent bucket.

You consider putting “Leveling up accessibility maturity” in the Important and urgent category, but your first responsibility is to the team and the people you serve day to day. Also, the work that levelling up will require hinges on items on the Important and urgent list.

Leveling up accessibility maturity Office hours support Accessibility Handbook updates Onboarding new teams Community of practice management Engaging with the disability ERG

Urgent and not important

These are things that have to get done sooner than later because they either are critical to your buy-in from leadership or a critical service.

Report to leadership about maturity level

Teams chat support

Not important and not urgent

These items are things that can wait or be put to the wayside. And yes, that includes the beloved but time-consuming design workshops.

This is also a place to indicate services you might alter. For example, maybe the next time you do onboarding with a team, it’s asynchronous. That could be a way to offload some meeting time for the team.

Self-guided course updates

Design workshops

Lunch and learns

Onboarding meetings, as opposed to other ways we could onboard

You end up with a chart like this:

Figure 33: Activities and responsibilities sorted by the priority.

Based on these results, it’s pretty clear that the team wants to dig into the hard work of engaging with HR and DEIB as soon as possible. They know from experience that this is going to be an effort to work in solidarity with those teams, which takes work and dedication. It won’t be effective to just lead these teams to doing accessibility work. N

You need to figure out what makes them care about disability and accessibility and meet them there. You also want to partner with them for the long term, so it’ll be important to find out how you can help them in their goals as well. Over time, you can hopefully come to a point where you can harmonize on common goals, too.

Your team members also want to prioritize raising literacy and increasing independence for ICs. The team is okay with deprioritizing formal course updates, design workshops, lunch and learns, and the meetings that go with onboarding. You also discuss looking at data for office hours to consider cutting hours to give your team more time to build out asynchronous resources.

Priorities for personal development

To help your specialists continue to grow, you propose having them pair off to lead certain activities or initiatives and learn from each other. This will require some more organizational time from everyone up front, but it should help to strengthen bonds between the team. It should also help reduce dependencies where one person is usually responsible for the same thing.

Jamie and Riho will pair on leading education and literacy, since Riho wants to grow her instructional skills. You’ll be bulking up the Handbook and other self-serve resources, and Riho has a lot of insight into patterns and behaviors in the discussion channel and office hours.

Caprice and Jamie will pair on leading outreach to the disability ERG. This will build on Jamie’s existing relationship with the group

and Caprice’s previous experience with ERGs. It will also help Caprice engage with more people with disabilities and learn more from Jamie about instruction.

Riho and Caprice will pair on assessing and tracking accessibility maturity for gap areas. This will capitalize on Riho’s systemsthinking brain and Caprice’s deep knowledge of how people are interconnected in the organization. It’ll also give Riho a chance to talk with individuals or small groups through community readiness interviews to practice her facilitation skills.

You will primarily focus on program-level tasks like the report to leadership and outreach to the DEIB and HR teams. To do that, you’ll need to say no to other time-consuming meetings and requests that aren’t part of these priorities, or delegate them to your team.

While you brainstormed this configuration, you realize you’ve started created some OKRs for the team. So let’s talk about outputs and outcomes!

Potential outputs and outcomes

Here are some potential outputs and outcomes to meet and measure the goals in this scenario. 0 You can leverage the organization’s annual theme of “Performance” to cover how your team is updating the onboarding process as well as your efforts to level up maturity.

OKR: Education and literacy

Outputs

Accessibility Handbook expansion Self-guided course maintenance Reduced office hours Teams chat support Community of practice

KPIs

Increase readership of the Handbook by X% Maintain X% completion rate for courses Grow community of practice (by X%)

OKR: Outreach

Outputs

HR program DEIB partnership Disability ERG partnership Communicate changes in services

KPIs

Deliver training to HR

Deliver program or event with DEIB Communicate changes and reasons for updates in services

OKR: Performance

Outputs

Onboarding refresh Maturity and readiness review and projections Maturity and readiness report to leadership

KPIs

Onboarding completion increases (by X%) Time to onboard decreases (by X%) Accessibility maturity report delivered in Q1 Accessibility maturity raises from Launch to Integrate Accessibility maturity rating scores increase (by X%)

This is a bit of a magic trick so you can appear to be doing more with less. By reducing your high-touch services in Education and literacy, you’re freeing up your team to do more deep, systemic work. While this might make people grumpy to start, you can point back to your mandate from leadership and the realities of your constraints. If you’re up front and transparent about the changes, people will adjust.

You can also point to all the accumulated evidence you have that this plan you’ve created is what needs to happen next. You’re tuning your program to do what it needs to do on paper and in reality: stretch across the gap from Launch to Integrate. This requires a lift not just from your team, but from the rest of the organization as well. Your team is here to facilitate, not hand-hold, and everyone (including you) needs to get used to it.

Chapter summary

This chapter was about setting realistic goals to meet an organization’s needs with limited resources. It focused on prioritizing efforts to grow equity through collaboration, deepen literacy through self-serve resources, and refine your team’s processes and workflows. It also discussed considering shifting services, products, or community engagement around to meet your goals.

Afterword

If you are still reading, I hope that means you’ve gotten something from this book. Take some time to consider how you can apply the ideas I’ve presented here to your own accessibility practice. Run some tests and see what works for you. I would love to hear about what you’re trying, what’s worked, what’s failed, and what you’re excited about. This book, like your practice, is an experiment! You can email me about what you’ve been doing at book@dpersing.com. I would love to hear what has and hasn't worked for you in your practice.

I know it may feel like you are not making even a dent in your organization’s culture. It may feel like leadership is never going to listen. It may feel like any change you make can be reverted without notice.

Even so, I promise that you are impacting people. Even if you are not keen on the people-work of accessibility practice, you are still impacting how people think about their work, about the people the work is for, and about themselves. The biggest impact you will have as an accessibility practitioner will be on the people in your organization, by modeling anti-ableist attitudes and fostering healthy connections between people and technologies.

The only thing that will save us is to create and foster community and equity with other people experiencing and fighting oppression,

to normalize accessibility and disability in our workplaces and communities.

That’s it! That’s the work. See you out there.
